Aims To describe the diet composition and aspects of the food supply of the Lesser Spotted Eagle during the nesting period. Methods Cameras were installed at five nests of three pairs of the Lesser Spotted Eagle in eastern Latvia, to collect data on food items brought to the nests. Results Of 3109 identified prey items, small rodents (43.36%) and amphibians (44.81%) were the most important prey groups. The proportion of common (small rodents and amphibians) and uncommon (moles, birds and others) food items differed between nests and years. Among the common food items, the deficiency of small rodents in some years was compensated for by an increase in frogs and vice versa. Male eagles brought 66% of all food items to the nest. Females brought more amphibians and fewer rodents than did males. After hatching, the mean number of food items delivered to the nest was 6.9 per day. The main activity period of food delivery was between the 3rd to 7th hour after sunrise. Conclusion The alternative prey hypothesis explains the diet of the Lesser Spotted Eagle in our study area. Rodents and amphibians are food items of equal importance that can replace each other, depending on their availability. The increasing share of amphibians towards the end of the breeding season was mainly a result of an increasing proportion of prey items brought into the nest by females.",2022,68,319,329,,10.1080/00063657.2022.2049204,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00063657.2022.2049204,1,1,0,proportion female,

A basic method in the study of bird reproductive ecology involves nest visits, but these can adversely affect birds' breeding success. Appropriate fieldwork procedures are therefore highly important, especially in the case of timid and sensitive species. This study aimed to assess the impact of the method of searching for nests of Red-backed Shrike Lanius coilurio on the probability of these birds abandoning their broods. Our study revealed that observer experience and nest searching intensity did influence the likelihood of brood desertion by this species. Less field experience and a greater nest searching intensity caused the shrikes to abandon their nests more often. We recommend paying scrupulous attention to the behaviour of the birds when searching for nests and when looking for nests after incubation has started.",2022,69,,,126249,10.1016/j.jnc.2022.126249,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2022.126249,0,,,,

Our objectives were to compare the provisioning behavior of male and female Loggerhead Shrikes (Lanius ludovicianus), and determine how their provisioning behavior was influenced by nestling age. The provisioning behavior of six pairs of Loggerhead Shrikes was videotaped from 15 April to 15 August 2004-2007 in Garrard and Madison counties, Kentucky, USA. For each nest visit by a shrike, the sex of the visiting adult, number of prey items delivered, size of prey, type of prey, and the duration of the nest visit were recorded. Adults made 2169 visits to nests, with males (49%) and females (51%) making similar numbers of visits. Males and females differed in time spent at nests, with males spending less time at nests per visit (mean = 12.0 s, N = 1062) than females (77.0 s, N = 1107). Feeding rates did not differ between the sexes, but feeding rates did increase with nestling age. The size of prey delivered to nestlings also tended to increase with nestling age. Invertebrates comprised 65% of the identified prey items, and cached items made up the remaining 35%. Although many passerine species increase provisioning rates as nestling demand increases, the caching behavior of shrikes may allow adults to reliably increase both feeding rates and prey size as nestling age and demand increase as well as act as buffers when prey availability declines. The caching behavior of shrikes provides them with parental provisioning strategies not available to non-caching songbirds.",2022,15,93,99,1.76E+16,10.1177/17581559221092692,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/17581559221092692,1,1,1,,1

We quantified helping efforts in a tropical population of the babbler, and tested the hypothesis that inter-sexual differences in helping efforts are related to the chance of inheriting their natal territory. We found that the total nest visiting rate during the nestling period and fledging success were higher among larger groups, but dominant birds (breeders) did not decrease their effort with group size. The total nest visiting rate during the nestling period increased with the number of female helpers, and fledging success was higher in groups with a female-biased sex ratio. In contradiction of the above hypothesis, female helpers contributed more towards nestling care than male helpers, although the latter contributed more towards nest building. There was no tendency for helpers to contribute more care towards nestlings of related breeders than those of unrelated breeders, suggesting that indirect (kin selection) benefits for helpers may be less important than direct benefits in explaining helping behaviour in this population. Our study suggests there may be sex-specific differences in the costs and benefits of helping behaviour.",2022,122,77,86,,10.1080/01584197.2022.2072347,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01584197.2022.2072347,1,1,1,,1
2022-5,"Tilgar, V; Hein, K; Viigipuu, R",Anthropogenic noise alters the perception of a predator in a local community of great tits,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Anthropogenic noise is increasing at an alarming rate in urban as well as rural ecosystems and detrimental effects have been reported on many animals relying on acoustic communication. Little is known regarding the impact of different types of noise on community level predator perception and breeding behaviour. Here, we presented a predator model alone or a predator combined with a specific noise type, such as traffic, a lawnmower or a chainsaw, to breeding pairs of great tits, Parus major, giving them the opportunity to perform mobbing behaviour that could provide public information to their neighbours. We then measured the provisioning behaviour of adjacent tit pairs, which were 50-150 m away from the focal pairs' nests. The adjacent breeding pairs decreased nest visits when focal birds were exposed to the sparrowhawk model or to the sparrowhawk model combined with the lawnmower noise. Neighbouring pairs did not reduce the rate of nest visits when focal birds were exposed to the hawk model combined with the traffic or the chainsaw noise. The distance from focal nests did not alter the noise effect on neighbouring pairs. We suggest that auditory masking is the most likely mechanism to explain why noise compromises public information. The chainsaw and traffic noise overlap with the frequency of mobbing calls and disrupt the transmission of auditory signals in the community. Further, when the hawk presentation was combined with the chainsaw noise, which was the type of noise that had the highest frequencies, the latency of mobbing by the focal birds was strongly increased, and the number of species involved in mobbing was reduced. This study demonstrates that the signalling function of mobbing is ineffective in noisy environments which ultimately impacts fitness via increased predation to adults or their offspring.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Although parental care is a well-studied phenomenon, most studies have been focused on direct observational or video recording data, as well as experimental manipulation. Therefore, what happens out of our sight still remains unknown. Using high-frequency GPS/GSM dataloggers and tri-axial accelerometers we monitored 25 Bonelli's eagles Aquila fasciata during the breeding season to understand parental activities from a broader perspective. We used recursive data, measured as number of visits and residence time, to reveal nest attendance patterns of biparental care with role specialization between sexes. Accelerometry data interpreted as the overall dynamic body acceleration, a proxy of energy expenditure, showed strong differences in parental effort throughout the breeding season and between sexes. Thereby, males increased substantially their energetic requirements, due to the increased workload, while females spent most of the time on the nest. Furthermore, during critical phases of the breeding season, a low percentage of suitable hunting spots in eagles' territories led them to increase their ranging behavior in order to find food, with important consequences in energy consumption and mortality risk. Our results highlight the crucial role of males in raptor species exhibiting biparental care. Finally, we exemplify how biologging technologies are an adequate and objective method to study parental care in raptors as well as to get deeper insight into breeding ecology of birds in general.",2022,68,57,67,,10.1093/cz/zoab010,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cz/zoab010,1,1,1,,1
2022-7,"Enns, J; Williams, TD","Paying attention but not coordinating: parental care in European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"Sexual conflict occurs in biparental species because working together provides shared benefits while incurring individual costs. In birds, coordination of provisioning visits via turn taking has been proposed as a strategy to mitigate this conflict. However, alternation of visits requires that birds have access to reliable information on their partner's behaviour, e.g. through high synchrony of nest visits or short foraging distances (allowing for direct observation of partners). Here we investigated parental coordination in the European starling, a species that forages at considerable distances from the nest (200 -1600 m), where there is no evidence that pairs forage together, and where synchrony at the nest appears to be low, so that direct access to information on partners will be variable and limited. There was some evidence that individuals were 'paying attention' to their partner's provisioning rate, adjusting their behaviour in response to their partner's behaviour. In first broods, female intervisit intervals that were preceded by a male visit (order of visits: male, female, female) were longer than those that were preceded by a female visit (order of visits: female, female, female). Females and males both responded to mate removal by decreasing their provisioning rates though these returned to preremoval levels the day after removal. This is consistent with 'matching' of parental workload not 'partial compensation'. These results suggest that birds do adjust their behaviour in relation to information about their partner's behaviour or absence/presence. However, despite this, there was no evidence of true coordination via alternation or synchrony (i.e. this was not different from random) in European starlings.Crown Copyright (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

For many populations, there is an urgent need to maintain breeding populations at key sites, and conservation practitioners need to find viable management solutions to reduce predation. One tool available to the practitioner is fences that exclude key predators from areas containing breeding birds. Temporary electric fencing is an increasingly popular predator exclusion intervention, but such fences have costs associated with purchase and the time needed to erect and maintain them. Their effectiveness and optimal application are also frequently questioned. We evaluate the use of temporary ditch-side four-strand electric fences in lowland grasslands in two countries, The Netherlands and England, in areas containing high densities of breeding waders. In both countries and in all years, godwit and lapwing nest survival was significantly higher within areas enclosed by ditch-side electric fences. Brood survival, assessed for godwits in The Netherlands, was also higher within fenced areas in all years. This demonstrates that using temporary electric fences to enclose ground-nesting birds can be an effective tool for improving breeding productivity. In our study, closely managed electric fences were effective at excluding red foxes Vulpes vulpes, but not avian and other mammalian predators. The positive effect that electric fencing had on nest and brood survival therefore likely results from a reduction in the total number of visits by mammalian predators, and especially visits by foxes. Although it requires a substantial time investment throughout the period of use, our temporary electric fence design provides flexibility compared to other fence designs when it comes to enclosing different areas within a season and between years, as the targets for protection change or as land and flood management dictate. This conservation intervention can help buy the time required to develop and implement longer term solutions for application at larger scales.",2022,3,,,e12143,10.1002/2688-8319.12143,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2688-8319.12143,0,,,,
2022-9,"Maynard, LD; Gulka, J; Jenkins, E; Davoren, GK",AT-COLONY BEHAVIOUR OF GREAT BLACK-BACKED GULLS LARUS MARINUS FOLLOWING BREEDING FAILURE,MARINE ORNITHOLOGY,"Territoriality for breeding sites comes at an energetic cost-individuals actively defend the site from competitors and potential predators, thus precluding themselves from self-maintenance (e.g., foraging, preening) or offspring care. Breeding individuals are also constrained to centralplace foraging within a limited range of the territory. For these reasons, many seabirds do not spend extensive periods or make regular visits to the colony following breeding failure. To investigate behaviour following breeding failure, we studied colony and nest attendance and daily number of visits for six Great Black-backed Gulls Larus marinus that had failed to breed following global positioning system (GPS) tag attachment on the northeast coast of Newfoundland, Canada. Three failed breeders reduced colony and nest attendance by an average 6.32 h/d (95% confidence interval: 1.14) after the estimated date of failure. Conversely, three other failed breeders showed no decrease in attendance, and one individual increased colony attendance by 5.4 h/d. We predicted that failed breeders would be more likely to forage while attending the colony relative to active breeders (i.e., incubating or chick-rearing) due to their lack of offspring and territory to defend. During 18 two-hour nest watches of active and failed breeders, active breeders (n = 4) behaved more aggressively (e.g., predation, swooping) toward gulls at nearby sites in the colony, while failed breeders (n = 6) behaved mostly passively (e.g., preening, sitting, P = 0.029). Our findings indicate that failed breeders continue to attend the colony after breeding failure, indicating potential benefits (e.g., maintaining breeding territory and pair bonding). Our findings also reveal that using tracking data to indicate breeding failure may be misleading and, thus, we suggest researchers also use visual confirmation of breeding failure, when possible, in future studies. Finally, we warn researchers of the negative effects of tag attachment on gull reproductive success.",2022,50,197,204,,,,0,,,,

Little is known about how parental care is shared in pairs of sexually monomorphic species. Red-headed Woodpeckers (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) are a sexually monomorphic and socially monogamous species in an almost exclusively dimorphic family (> 99% of species; Picidae). We assessed duration of diurnal incubation and brooding and frequency of nestling provisioning and nest cleaning for individually marked breeding Red-headed Woodpeckers at Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia, USA. Individuals were genetically sexed using DNA from feather samples. In addition to parent sex, we evaluated the influence of nestling characteristics (brood size and nestling age) and exogenous factors (habitat type, date, and maximum daily temperature) on parental care behaviors. We recorded and analyzed video at nests during the incubation and nestling stages. We found that females diurnally incubate more than males and males almost exclusively remove fecal sacs from nests. Using generalized linear mixed models, we found females brood young nestlings more than males, but males are the only parent to enter the cavity when chicks are > 10 days old. We found provisioning peaked during the middle of the nestling period, and provisioning frequency was higher in early summer (before 7 July) compared to late summer. The seasonal reduction in provisioning could be related to resource availability but warrants further study. This division of reproductive roles is common in dimorphic woodpecker species and supports the existence of energetic constraints to successfully fledge altricial offspring.",2022,93,,,3,10.5751/JFO-00089-930203,http://dx.doi.org/10.5751/JFO-00089-930203,1,1,1,,1
2022-11,"White, AF; Dawson, RD",Manipulations of brood age reveal limited parental flexibility in an insectivorous passerine,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,"For birds with altricial nestlings, behavioural flexibility in provisioning may be essential to success, as it enables parents to respond to changes in offspring demand. While parents often increase the quantity of food they provide as nestlings grow, they may also adjust different aspects of this suite of behaviours (i.e. feeding rate, prey type and size and distribution within broods) flexibly in response to nestling age. We tested whether generalist insectivores, mountain bluebirds, Sialia currucoides, respond to abrupt shifts in the body size of nestlings the same way they do when nestlings age normally. During a short-term (within-day) manipulation of nestling age, we recorded provisioning behaviour of parents feeding their own ('natal') and an age-manipulated (increased or decreased by 4 days) brood on the same day, in addition to recording provisioning ~4 days before or after, when natal broods were the same age as manipulated broods. Parents responded to the age manipulation by altering feeding rates, but when broods aged naturally, parents altered the types and sizes of prey they delivered. Parents fed less often and provided larger prey when feeding younger-than-expected broods than when feeding young natal broods. Parents given older-than-expected broods fed more larvae, and fed more often, but provided smaller prey than supplied to older natal broods. Parents feeding older natal broods distributed prey more equitably among nestlings than those feeding either experimental older broods or younger broods (both natural and experimental broods), but this was not due to biased feeding of nestlings according to their body weight. Females fed more often than males and increased the quantity of larvae they provided to younger-than-expected broods. We suggest that parent mountain bluebirds can perceive and respond to both rapid and gradual changes in offspring size, but they may use different cues to adjust feeding rate and prey use.(c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

2022-12,"Baldan, D; van Loon, EE",Songbird parents coordinate offspring provisioning at fine spatio-temporal scales,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,"For parents, rearing offspring together is far from a purely cooperative exercise, as a conflict of interest ('sexual conflict') exists over their optimum level of care. Recent theory emphasizes that sexual conflict can be evolutionarily resolved, and complete parental cooperation can occur, if parents directly respond ('negotiate') to each other and coordinate their level of care. Despite numerous experiments showing that parents are responsive to each other, we still lack empirical evidence of the behavioural mechanisms by which this negotiation occurs. In this study, we investigated the spatio-temporal coordination of parental provisioning behaviour as a possible mechanism of negotiation over parental care. We deployed an automated radiotracking technology to track the provisioning activity of wild great tit Parus major pairs during chick rearing. Our analyses represent the first detailed spatial and temporal description of foraging coordination in songbird parents in a natural context. We demonstrate that the foraging behaviour of the two parents is highly coordinated in space and time, with parents changing their foraging locations in conjunction with their partners' movements. Therefore, foraging coordination could be a mechanism by which parents directly monitor and respond to each other's level of investment.",2022,91,1316,1326,,10.1111/1365-2656.13702,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13702,1,1,1,,1

This variation is thought to be an adaptive response to cope with environmental variation. The principal environmental factors affecting growth are food availability and predation risk, predominantly acting as constraints on parental care. Islands pose an interesting system to explore growth rate dynamics, because the characteristic insular features of high population densities and depauperate predator diversity translate into a potentially food limited environment with low predation risk. Insular environments typically produce populations with slower life history strategies and larger body size in small-bodied species, features that are likely to be mediated by growth rate. We describe the nestling growth of an insular population of Silvereyes and how it relates to parental size and parental care. Neither parental size nor parental care explained insular nestling growth rate, even though food acquisition is thought to underpin avian growth rates. This could be due to a mismatch between acquisition and allocation of resources by nestlings. Compared to a small number of mainland nestlings, the island growth curve asymptotes were significantly larger and inflection points much later, but insular growth rates were only marginally slower. This is in line with proposed insular adaptations required to produce larger body size on islands, however understanding the mechanism underlying this pattern will require data on the relationship between food quality and acquisition, and physiological allocation of resources within individuals.",2022,122,193,202,,10.1080/01584197.2022.2105723,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01584197.2022.2105723,1,1,1,,1

However, it is not well known exactly how this coordination is achieved. Manx shearwaters Puffinus puffinus are Procellariiform seabirds that exhibit a dual foraging strategy during chick provisioning in which long foraging trips to maintain condition are alternated with short, frequent trips to feed the offspring. This strategy is employed in a coordinated manner between the parents, with one making short trips while the other takes a single long trip. Previous work revealed that a complementary switch in foraging trip type is initiated by the parents following a synchronous visit to the nest. We used a combination of observational data and experimental manipulation to examine the mechanisms that may underlie this behaviour. Specifically, we investigated the evidence that physical reunion is necessary to induce a switch in trip type, whether parents change their behaviour to maximise the probability of partner encounter, and whether indirect cues gained from the chick could inform a switch in behaviour. In our experimental approach, we manipulated the information adults had available to them by supplementarily feeding chicks to alter their begging behaviour. We found no support for the role of physical reunion or indirect cues in the coordination of care in this species. We discuss the possibility that the patterns of alternated provisioning observed during chick rearing in Manx shearwaters may emerge through entrainment during the well-coordinated incubation period preceding chick provisioning.",2022,2022,,,,10.1111/jav.02881,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jav.02881,1,1,0,interval length,

However, males should avoid providing care to unrelated offspring. In this study, we first analyzed the relationship between parental care and paternity loss, and secondly, we evaluated if males adjust parental care to a perceived threat of cuckoldry. Over three breeding seasons, we intensively studied a color-banded population of south temperate grass wrens Cistothorus platensis. We monitored nests attended by socially monogamous males, collected blood samples from adults and nestlings, and recorded male provisioning rates to the nestlings. Paternity was assigned genetically using SNP markers. We simulated territorial intrusions during the female fertile period (egg-laying) to manipulate males' perceived threat of cuckoldry. Neither the proportion of extra-pair offspring nor the presence/absence of extra-pair offspring in the nest affected male provisioning rates, suggesting that males did not adjust parental effort to actual paternity loss. Simulated territorial intrusions revealed that males were more likely to approach and attack a conspecific than a heterospecific stuffed decoy. However, experimental and control males provided food to their nestlings at similar rates. Retaliatory reduction of paternal care might not have evolved in grass wrens given the low frequency of extra-pair paternity (23%). Alternatively, males may rely predominately on precopulatory strategies (e.g., territoriality and mate guarding) to prevent females from obtaining extra-pair fertilizations. Significance statement A central tenet in the study of extra-pair behavior in birds is that males should reduce their parental contribution when females engage in extra-pair copulations. Males are thought to use indirect clues (female absences, male intrusions) and direct clues (observation of copulations) to gauge paternity loss. We studied the relationship between extra-pair behavior and male contribution to feeding nestlings in a Neotropical population of grass wrens. We found that males did not adjust their contribution to paternal care based on actual paternity loss. Moreover, simulated male intrusions during the female fertile period, which influence a male's perceived threat of cuckoldry, did not affect paternal care. Our results suggest that male grass wrens do not indirectly retaliate against females who engage in extra-pair behavior by reducing parental care.",2022,76,,,147,10.1007/s00265-022-03253-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-022-03253-y,1,1,1,,1

To date, however, there have been few examinations of the causes of this phenomenon. Here, we evaluated possible explanations of sex-specific provisioning in the monomorphic Leach's storm-petrel Hydrobates leucorhous (until recently Oceanodroma leucorhoa). We tracked the chick-rearing behavior of 74 mated pairs using an automated nest monitoring system and collected daily measurements of chick growth. We found that males provisioned more frequently and made a larger overall contribution to chick feeding than females. Within-individual trip duration was more variable for females, suggesting that they were alternating to a greater degree between short, energetically taxing trips that prioritize chick care and longer, recovery trips that prioritize self-care. Moreover, females were more likely to embark on longer trips after completing a short trip and after encountering a chick in good condition. Males, however, appeared better able to perform repeated short trips that resulted in more frequent provisioning as well as greater amounts overall. These findings are consistent with the explanation that energetic constraints on females give rise to male-biased, sex-specific provisioning in a monomorphic species and are likely to explain similar patterns in other long-lived species where adult survival is high.",2022,2022,,,,10.1111/jav.02904,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jav.02904,1,1,0,interval length,

Most avian obligate brood parasites have altricial offspring that require enormous amounts of posthatching parental care, and the large fecundity boost that comes with complete emancipation from parental care likely played a role in the independent evolution of obligate parasitism in several altricial lineages. The evolution of obligate parasitism in the black-headed duck, however, is puzzling because its self-feeding precocial offspring should not constrain parental fecundity of a potential brood parasite in the way that altricial offspring do. We used an experimental nest predation study to test the idea that high nest predation rates played a role in the evolution of brood parasitism in this enigmatic duck. Experimental duck eggs in untended nests suffered massive rapid predation, while eggs in tended nests of the three main hosts, all aggressive nest defenders, had very high success, illustrating the benefits of parasitizing these 'bodyguard' hosts.",2022,12,,,e9251,10.1002/ece3.9251,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.9251,0,,,,

In contrast to males, almost all females of this species desert during the chick-rearing and post-fledging periods. Because of the expected link between corticosterone, prolactin and parental investment, we hypothesized that males and females should differ in circulating prolactin and corticosterone concentrations. Baseline hormone concentrations did not differ between males and females. In both sexes, prolactin and corticosterone concentrations decreased and increased in response to acute stress (30 min after capture), respectively. Baseline and stress-induced prolactin concentrations decreased significantly in both sexes with advancing brood age. As expected, males had significantly higher stress-induced prolactin concentrations than females. None of the nine males released after being held in captivity for 24 h deserted, whereas four (29%) of the 14 females kept in captivity for 24 h did so. Altogether, these results suggest that higher prolactin concentrations may be involved in the maintenance of parental care under stress. However, there was no statistically significant difference in stress-induced hormone levels between males, females that deserted and those that returned to the nest after prolonged stress (24 h). Our data indicate that males are probably more resistant to stress as regards the continuation of parental care. The pattern of male and female behavioural and hormonal responses to stress partially predicts their behaviour in terms of natural desertion.",2022,317,,,113943,10.1016/j.ygcen.2021.113943,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2021.113943,0,,,,

We studied brood division in golden-winged warblers Vermivora chrysoptera to describe the spatial and behavioural characteristics of brood division and assess hypotheses describing the potential benefits of brood division. Female golden-winged warblers are known to travel farther from their nests than males within the post-fledging period, although the mechanism resulting in this spatial pattern is unknown. From 2010 to 2012, we monitored radio-marked golden-winged warbler fledglings from fledging until independence from adult care at three sites in the western Great Lakes region of North America. We observed no significant differences in provisioning, parental attendance, daily distance traveled and fledgling begging between male- and female-reared sub-broods. We also did not observe a relationship between parental sex and fledgling sex or mass. However, female-reared sub-broods exhibited a unique period of relatively consistent directional movement on days 8-10 after fledging, which resulted in females traveling farther from the nests than males.

For example, low parental care impairs adult socio-cognitive abilities (e.g., recognizing familiar conspecifics) and affiliation (e.g., close social proximity); outcomes attributed to diminished medial amygdala nonapeptide functioning in rodents. Whether parental care has effects beyond familiarity, and if siblings have similar effects to parents, is unclear. Here, zebra finches were used to explore if parent and/or sibling number shape adult recognition and preference of small versus large flocks and nonapeptide (oxytocin, vasotocin) receptor expression in an avian homologue of the mammalian medial amygdala. Chicks were raised by single mothers or fathers in small broods or paired parents in small or large broods matched to single parents for chicks per nest or per parent, respectively. Pair-raised birds had preferred flock sizes as adults, but birds raised by single parents had equal preference for either size. Oxytocin receptor expression was lower in birds raised by single parents versus paired parents, but vasotocin receptor levels were unaffected. Such results highlight parents as formative antecedents of their offspring's social competencies related to group size preference and their nonapeptide mechanisms, outcomes that influence an animal's ability to live in social groups.",2022,64,,,e22307,10.1002/dev.22307,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/dev.22307,0,,,,

Rock Wrens (Salpinctes obsoletus) are migratory in the northern part of their range, territorial, and monogamous songbirds with populations thought to be in decline. We collected natural history infomration on 21 mated pairs from a migratory population in northern Colorado to describe nesting ecology and reproductive success. We evaluated nesting life-history traits and parental care throughout the breeding season at 12 monitored nests. Results indicated that 42.9% of nests fledged at least 1 chick, with means (+/- SD) of 5.63 +/- 1 eggs per clutch, 3.44 +/- 0.53 hatchlings per nest, and 2.67 1: 0.5 fledglings per nest.

Weather may exert proximate effects on offspring energy expenditure, but in altricial species these might be masked by parental care and huddling with siblings. Such effects are particularly important to understand given changing global weather patterns, yet studies of wild offspring in the presence of parental care are lacking. Offspring energy expenditure may also vary among species due to evolved responses to environmental selection pressures, requiring studies at both proximate and ultimate levels. Location USA, South Africa, Malaysia. Time period 2016-2019. Major taxa studied Songbirds. Methods We used the doubly-labelled water technique to estimate nestling daily energy expenditure of 54 songbird species across three continents. We used Bayesian phylogenetic mixed models to test proximate and evolutionary causes of variation in offspring energy expenditure while accounting for phylogeny and phylogenetic uncertainty. Results Offspring energy expenditure increased with more rainfall and colder air temperatures, but decreased among offspring in broods with more siblings. Across species, nestling and adult mortality, but not growth rate, were positively associated with offspring energy use. Main conclusions Weather had clear proximate effects on offspring energy expenditure and parents were either unable or unwilling to fully offset these effects. However, the decrease in offspring energy use when huddling with more siblings demonstrated a modulating effect of life history traits. For example, high nest predation rates favour reduced parental care and can force offspring to spend more energy coping with environmental conditions. Furthermore, reduced energy expenditure is thought to facilitate increased longevity, which is increasingly realized with lower extrinsic mortality rates, providing an explanation for the positive association between adult mortality and offspring energy expenditure. Ultimately, both proximate and evolutionary influences need to be considered to better understand causes of offspring energetics.",2022,31,765,775,,10.1111/geb.13467,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.13467,0,,,,

Based on these studies, however, genetic inheritance does not account fully for the often-significant phenotypic variability observed within species, a variation that we hypothesized may be explained by social effects from parents. Following a full cross-fostering design, here we aimed at disentangling genetic and social parental effects in the ontogeny of parental behaviours. Clutches of eggs were swapped, and we monitored parental behaviours in two consecutive generations of a captive population of the socially monogamous, biparental zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata). Using nest box cameras, parental behaviour was recorded for 3 h in two reproductive stages: on day 8 of incubation and day 10 post-hatching. These fostered birds, after becoming fully matured, received a pair randomly and we observed parental care of this second generation too, following the same protocol. We then compared various parental behaviours (such as time spent incubating, or number of nest attendances during offspring provisioning) in the second generation to those of their genetic and social parents. Based on the results of our experiment, both genetic and social effects can contribute to intergenerational transmission of specific parental behaviours, with various weights. However, the strongest and most consistent effect that we found is that of the current mate; a social effect that can manifest both in negative and positive directions, depending on the behavioural trait. Our study suggests context-specific and sexually different genetic, social and non-social environmental effects in the ontogeny of parental sex roles and outline the importance of parental negotiation in explaining individual variation of parental behaviour in biparental species.",2022,9,,,799996,10.3389/fevo.2021.799996,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2021.799996,1,1,1,,1

Urban areas are associated with changes in microclimate, light, noise and human activity, which can affect animal physiology, behaviour and fitness. In particular, urbanization may affect how parents allocate time and energy between parental care and self-maintenance. In birds, a critical aspect of parental care is incubation, where parents must maintain egg temperatures for suc-cessful offspring development. However, incubation is energetically costly, and anthropogenic distur-bances may affect parental decisions related to this cost. Determining whether urbanization affects incubation is crucial for understanding the differences between urban and nonurban populations in their reproductive performance and fitness. We measured incubation behaviour and egg temperature in one urban and one forest population of great tits, a uniparental incubator, using temperature loggers. We found that, compared to forest females, urban females spent more time incubating, took shorter off -bouts and ended their last daily off-bouts at a later hour. Furthermore, time spent off the nest, the number and duration of off-bouts and daily start of activity were related to ambient temperature; start of activity was related to clutch size; and time spent off the nest was related to the day of incubation. Despite urban females spending more time on the nest, eggs of both forest and urban females experi-enced relatively similar average egg temperatures, and urban eggs tended to experience greater vari-ability in egg temperature. Furthermore, there were no differences between sites for any fitness-related offspring variable. Our results suggest that urbanization can influence the thermal environment of developing avian offspring by causing urban adults to be inefficient incubators through increased activity off the nest in the evening, differences in nest insulation and/or suboptimal incubation behaviour compared to forest counterparts.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

We measured between-individual variation in provisioning latency in two urban adapters - great tits and blue tits - in response to an infrared camera installed in the nestbox, encountered when offspring in the nest were at the peak of food demand (9-10-days old). For each nestbox, we quantified urbanization as intensity in human activity, distance to road and proportion of impervious surface area. In both species, provisioning latency increased closer to roads. Moreover, increased provisioning latency when exposed to a novel object was associated with higher reproductive success in great tits whose nestboxes were surrounded by high amounts of impervious surface. In contrast, increased provisioning latency was consistently associated with lower reproductive success in blue tits. Our results suggest that provisioning latency changes in relation to the environment surrounding the nest, and may be context- and species-specific when exposed to a novel stimulus, such as a novel object in the nest.

For example, avian insectivores that feed nestlings with grasshoppers, beetles, or moths perform insect prey preparation before feeding nestlings so that the nestlings are able to swallow the prey. This behavior is generally not expected for soft prey such as earthworms. However, an overview of photographic evidence available online suggested that earthworms are sundered by parents before bringing the prey to the nestlings in a range of species from several families of vermivores worldwide. Reports on the provisioning of nestlings by the vermivores are relatively scant and no report on earthworm sundering has been published. We studied earthworm sundering performed by parents provisioning their broods at four nests of the Fairy Pitta in Korea. The birds sundered earthworms more often when nestlings were smaller and when the earthworm was longer. This is the first quantitative description of earthworm sundering in avian vermivores. We present and evaluate four hypotheses for the function of sundering: provisioning of small nestlings, decreased detectability, hunting multiple prey, and transport of prey. Among these, provisioning of small nestlings seems the most feasible explanation of sundering by the Fairy Pitta as sundering the earthworm allows parents to efficiently provision the younger/smaller nestlings who would have difficulties swallowing unsundered earthworms. This specialized prey preparation technique of vermivores suggests a tight adaptive match between their parental behaviors and their diet (vermivory).",2022,163,565,573,,10.1007/s10336-021-01955-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-021-01955-0,0,,,,

Across animals the seasonal patterns of androgens are tightly linked to many of the species' life-history traits and their evolution. One popular framework to address this issue has been the Challenge Hypothesis, which proposed a testosterone-mediated trade-off between mating and parental care in males. Given the lack of empirical support, especially in birds, this hypothesis has been recently revisited (Challenge Hypothesis 2.0), integrating aspects such as male-female interactions and the diversity of reproductive systems in birds. Ratites constitute the most basal avian group (Palaeognathae: ratites together with Tinamiformes) and have certain characteristics that make them unique. They are flightless and generally have promiscuous mating systems with communal nests and maleonly parental care (nest building, incubation and chick rearing). Furthermore, male testosterone concentrations remain high during the entire parental care period. Here we review the reproductive biology of ratites, integrating information on seasonal variations in parental care, social interactions and androgen levels across the group, in light of the Challenge Hypotheses and the Challenge Hypothesis 2.0 (there are no seasonal hormonal data for Tinamiformes, therefore they are not included in this review).

Our first objective was to study the effects that loud traffic noise had on nestling begging calls in European Starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, an urban-thriving species.

Also, nestlings in experimental broods continued to beg at a higher minimum frequency but with a narrowed bandwidth after the playback was stopped. Parental provisioning rates did not differ between control and experimental broods, nor did fledging success, although nestlings in the experimental group were in poorer condition.

Avian parental investment decisions have been studied either via brood size manipulation or direct manipulation of parental energetic costs (also known as handicapping). However, we have limited experimental data on the potential interactive effects of these manipulations on parent behavior. Additionally, we know little about how these manipulations affect spatial foraging behavior away from the nest. We simultaneously manipulated brood size and parental costs (via added weight in the form of a GPS tag) in wild female barn swallows (Hirundo rustica). We measured multiple aspects of parent behavior at and away from the nest while controlling for measures of weather conditions. We found no significant interactive effects of manipulated brood size and parental costs. Both sexes increased their visitation rate with brood size, but nestlings in enlarged broods grew significantly less post-brood size manipulation than those in reduced broods. Foraging range area was highly variable among GPS-tagged females but was unaffected by brood size. As such, increased visitation rate in response to brood size may be more energetically costly for far-ranging females. GPS-tagged females did not alter their visitation rate relative to un-tagged birds, but their mates had higher visitation rates. This suggests that GPS tagging may affect some unmeasured aspect of female behavior, such as prey delivery. Our findings indicate that investigation of foraging tactics alongside visitation rate is critical to understanding parental investment and the benefits and costs of reproduction. Significance statement Avian parental investment decisions have been studied by either brood size manipulation or direct manipulation of parental costs, but rarely both simultaneously. We simultaneously manipulated brood size and parental costs (via addition of a GPS tag) in a wild avian system, allowing us to examine interactive effects of these manipulations. Additionally, studies of parental investment often examine behaviors at the nest, but measurements of parental care behavior away from the nest are rare. Our study is unique in that we measured multiple aspects of parental care, including spatial foraging behavior tracked with GPS tags.

Specialist brood parasites use visual and vocal mimicry of host offspring to induce host parents to care for the parasite offspring. Generalist brood parasites, however, use different tactics to obtain host parental care. Here, we examine how brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) restructure host red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) broods and the consequent effects on the expected survival of the brood parasite nestling. Competition within the host brood is governed by an asymmetric sibling rivalry, with the size of the core brood driving the survival of both core and marginal nestlings. Competitively inferior marginal nestlings conversely have little effect on core nestlings. Cowbirds primarily removed core host nestlings when altering the size and structure of host broods. Host brood size at hatching was reduced in conjunction with parasitism by cowbirds. The resulting brood structures differed markedly from those in unparasitized broods with most notably fewer core nestlings, the most potent competitors for the cowbird nestling. Marginal brood size, however, differed only slightly. This reflects the competitive dynamics: core but not marginal brood size affected cowbird survival. The same asymmetric nestling rivalry that governs competition among host nestlings applies to these brood parasitic cowbirds as well; by altering host family structure, they enhanced the effective environment for their nestlings. Significance statement Obligate brood parasites must purloin parental care from unrelated host species to rear offspring. Generalist brood parasites, such as cowbirds, face an especially steep challenge, as the offspring are not visual or vocal mimics of host offspring: they are inserted into the host brood and must compete against host offspring. Here, we show that changes in host brood size and structure associated with cowbird parasitism enhance the effective environment for the brood parasite nestling. Through the removal/damage of host eggs or interference with host egg hatching, host brood size is reduced, and most importantly, the number of first-hatched core offspring that are the most potent competitors for the brood parasite offspring.

Biomarkers of ageing, such as telomeres, that tend to shorten as individuals age, may provide insight into the mechanisms of such parental age effects. Parental age may be associated with offspring telomere length either directly through inheritance of shortened telomeres or indirectly, for example, through changes in parental care in older parents affecting offspring telomere length. Across the literature there is considerable variation in estimates of the heritability of telomere length, and in the direction and extent of parental age effects on telomere length. To address this, we experimentally tested how parental age is associated with the early-life telomere dynamics of chicks at two time points in a captive population of house sparrows Passer domesticus. We experimentally separated parental age from sex effects, and removed effects of age-assortative mating, by allowing the parent birds to only mate with young, or old partners. The effect of parental age was dependent on the sex of the parent and the chicks, and was found in the father-daughter relationship only; older fathers produced daughters with longer telomere lengths post-fledging. Overall we found that chick telomere length increased between the age of 0.5 and 3 months at the population and individual level. This finding is unusual in birds with such increases more commonly associated with non-avian taxa. Our results suggest parental age effects on telomere length are sex-specific either through indirect or direct inheritance.

Up to 12 pairs may nest concurrently in the same tree or, less frequently, two adjacent trees, potentially facilitating both conspecific brood parasitism and extra-pair mating. Contrary to our predictions, genotyping with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) revealed no evidence of extra-pair paternity in either solitary or colonial nests: all 307 nestlings in 101 broods were matched to their social parents. Two instances of apparent conspecific brood parasitism were detected via changes in clutch size, but these could not be confirmed genetically since none of the apparently parasitic eggs survived to hatching. Therefore, if conspecific brood parasitism did occur, it was not a successful route to reproduction: parents fledged only their genetic offspring. These results suggest that reproductive opportunities alone are insufficient to favor alternative reproductive tactics, and that genetic monogamy can persist despite locally high densities of breeding pairs. Other life-history traits, including high levels of nest attendance and male parental care, may constrain parasitism and extra-pair mating in this long-lived tropical species. Significance statement High breeding density, a feature of colonial nesting, should increase opportunities for infidelity and conspecific brood parasitism because of the close proximity of potential extra-pair mates and parasitic females. Yet, we found that Hispaniolan woodpeckers, which nest both solitarily and colonially (two or more pairs in the same tree) in the same population, were genetically monogamous and lacked successful brood parasitism. Colonial nesting is exceptionally rare in the woodpecker family, which is also characterized by high investment in male parental care, including nocturnal incubation. The essential role of paternal care for successful reproduction in the Hispaniolan woodpecker might have selected against extra-pair mating and conspecific brood parasitism despite the apparent ample opportunities provided by nesting so close to others.",2022,76,,,72,10.1007/s00265-022-03178-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-022-03178-6,0,,,,

This is a striking but rarely addressed question in life-history evolution. Here we comparatively explore it using phylogenetically paired passerine birds of lowland China vs. the Tibetan plateau spanning an elevational range of 18-4500 m. Toward the Tibetan plateau, egg size increased, clutch size decreased and total clutch volume (= clutch size x egg size) did not change, when accounting for major confounding factors. Larger eggs and smaller clutches can be a response to harsh abiotic conditions at higher elevations and the corresponding reduction in food resources required for raising young, respectively. There was a negative correlation between egg size and clutch size after controlling for elevation effect on either trait, suggesting that the trade-off contributed to the expression of these two traits across elevations, given the lack of an elevational trend in total clutch volume. Tibetan birds had a shorter breeding season, prolonged incubation and nestling period than their lowland counterparts. While fewer clutches over the short breeding season may facilitate the increase in egg size, the concentration of annual reproductive investment did not seem to act on clutch size; despite the smaller clutches, hard environments may impose greater costs of parental care on Tibetan birds.

This breeding strategy requires decisions that may affect the parasite's reproductive success. During the breeding season, cowbirds search for host nests and revisit them to monitor its progress and parasitize at the time host laying begins. When visiting hosts nests, they repeatedly peck the nest contents trying to destroy one or more eggs. This behaviour favours parasite's offspring by reducing the competition for food with nestmates. We evaluated if the egg-pecking behaviour of female shiny (Molothrus bonariensis) and screaming (M. rufoaxillaris) cowbirds is affected by the strength and the size of the eggs they find in the nest. We presented to wild-caught females artificial clutches with two natural eggs that differ in size and shell strength. We found that female shiny and screaming cowbirds adjusted egg-pecking behaviour based on the strength but not on the size of the eggs. When differences in strength between eggs were high, both cowbird species pecked more frequently the egg with the weaker shell, increasing the probability of a successful puncture. Our results indicate that female cowbirds can discriminate eggs through the strength of the shell, and by choosing the weaker egg to peck, they increase the probability of puncturing.",2022,25,275,285,,10.1007/s10071-021-01549-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10071-021-01549-6,0,,,,

Prolactin underlies parental behaviors and related physiological changes across many vertebrates, including birds and mammals. While circulating prolactin levels often fluctuate across breeding, less is known about how relevant target tissues vary in their prolactin responsiveness via prolactin receptor (PRLR) expression. Recent studies have also investigated prolactin (PRL) gene expression outside of the pituitary (i.e., extra-pituitary PRL), but how PRL gene expression varies during parental care in non-pituitary tissue (e.g., hypothalamus, gonads) remains largely unknown. Further, it is unclear if and how tissue-specific PRL and PRLR vary between the sexes during biparental care. To address this, we measured PRL and PRLR gene expression in tissues relevant to parental care, the endocrine reproductive hypothalamic-pituitary- gonadal (HPG) axis and the crop (a tissue with a similar function as the mammalian mammary gland), across various reproductive stages in both sexes of a biparental bird, the rock dove (Columba livia). We also assessed how these genes responded to changes in offspring presence by adding chicks mid-incubation, simulating an early hatch when prolactin levels were still moderately low. We found that pituitary PRL expression showed similar increases as plasma prolactin levels, and detected extra-pituitary PRL in the hypothalamus, gonads and crop. Hypothalamic and gonadal PRLR expression also changed as birds began incubation. Crop PRLR expression correlated with plasma prolactin, peaking when chicks hatched. In response to replacing eggs with a novel chick mid-incubation, hypothalamic and gonadal PRL and PRLR gene expression differed significantly compared to mid-incubation controls, even when plasma prolactin levels did not differ. We also found sex differences in PRL and PRLR that suggest gene expression may allow males to compensate for lower levels in prolactin by upregulating PRLR in all tissues. Overall, this study advances our understanding of how tissue-specific changes in responsiveness to parental hormones may differ across key reproductive transitions, in response to offspring cues, and between the sexes.",2022,315,,,113940,10.1016/j.ygcen.2021.113940,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2021.113940,0,,,,

The factors underlying why species differ in movement behaviour of young and why some species form family groups while other species have dispersed young have rarely been addressed. We tested a hypothesis that siblings should be more dispersed in space and move less in species that have offspring with poor locomotor abilities to reduce the chance of the loss of the whole brood. In contrast, siblings should aggregate and move more when their mobility and ability to avoid predators is strong. We tested this hypothesis using songbirds because cavity- versus open-cup-nesting species strongly contrast in nesting strategy. Offspring of species that nest in cavities leave the nest with well-developed wings and initially are more mobile and incur lower predation rates than fledglings of species that nest in open-cups. We used radiotelemetry to track fledglings of three cavity- and three open-cup-nesting songbird species to test whether young differ in spatial dispersion and movement behaviour between nest types. We found that mobile young of cavity-nesting species moved farther on a daily basis but remained more aggregated as a family than the less mobile young of open-cup-nesting species. Movement distances increased with mobility as young aged, especially in open-cup-nesting species, but families of open-cup-nesting species remained dispersed throughout the first week after fledging.

Yet parent-offspring cannibalism is common and taxonomically widespread across the animal kingdom. In this review, I provide an overview of our current understanding of parent-offspring cannibalism, which has seen a proliferation in adaptive hypotheses over the past 20 years for why parents consume their own young. I review over four decades of research into this perplexing behaviour, drawing from work conducted on fishes, reptiles, insects, birds, and mammals among other taxa. Many factors have been hypothesised to explain parent-offspring cannibalism in nature, including poor parental energy reserves, small or large brood sizes, low or uncertain parentage, and high brood densities, and additional factors are still being uncovered. Parent-offspring cannibalism does not appear to have a single predominant explanation; rather, the factor, or set of factors, that govern its expression is largely taxon specific. Parents may either consume all offspring under their care (full-brood cannibalism) or consume a fraction of their offspring (partial brood cannibalism). These forms of cannibalism are thought to provide adaptive benefits to cannibals under a range of circumstances, primarily by allowing parents to allocate parental efforts more optimally - energy from eating (some of) one's current offspring can be redirected to other offspring, or to parental growth, survival, and ultimately to other future reproductive endeavours. Thus, parent-offspring cannibalism is a phenotypically plastic trait that responds to changing environmental, social, and physiological conditions. The expression of parent-offspring cannibalism in any given system is intimately linked to the reproductive value of current young relative to parents' expectations for future reproduction, and also to whether parental care is predominantly depreciable or non-depreciable. Furthermore, parent-offspring cannibalism has the potential to generate conflict between the sexes, and I briefly discuss some consequences of this conflict on patterns of mate choice. Finally, there still remain many aspects of this behaviour where our understanding is poor, and I highlight these topics to help guide future research.",2022,97,1868,1885,,10.1111/brv.12868,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/brv.12868,0,,,,

Parents that cannot meet the metabolic demands and other physiological costs of raising offspring may opt to abandon chicks in favour of self-maintenance and future reproduction. Recent work examining reproductive trade-offs in birds revealed an important role of oxygen carrying capacity in mediating variation in parental effort. This study explores the aerobic factors underlying the success or failure of parental care in two closely-related petrel species during their breeding season on Bird Island, South Georgia: northern giant petrels (Macronectes halli) and southern giant petrels (M. giganteus). Failed breeders of both sexes and species had significantly lower hematocrit levels (by 5.48 +/- 0.64%) than successful breeders, and reticulocyte counts also tended to be lower in failed males, consistent with the hypothesis that parental care and workload depend on aerobic capacity.

Why these birds form social groups is not completely understood, but one hypothesis is that the ability to hunt cooperatively may benefit groups with a higher hunting success rate or facilitate the capture of larger prey than an individual hawk could catch on its own. To test the hypothesis that group hunting affects patterns of prey delivery and the types of prey delivered to nests, we recorded videos of prey deliveries in May and June at nests of five breeding groups and five breeding pairs in Cameron County and Willacy County, 'texas. In contrast to the diets of Harris's Hawks in New Mexico and Arizona that depend heavily on lagomorphs, we documented mostly avian prey items (39.1% of prey deliveries) and rodent prey items (39.1%), and only 0.7% lagomorphs (n= 284 prey items recorded). Significantly more prey items per day were delivered to nests with more nestlings. Importantly, and contrary to our hypothesis, pairs delivered more prey items per day on average than groups; this pattern was not significant, but this may be attributable in part to a small sample size of nests.

To date, most studies on parental thermal effects have focused on maternal influences, because of the predominant role of females for parental care in most systems. Yet, paternal thermal effects are equally expected to occur in species that display paternal care to the progeny. We studied the midwife toad, a small amphibian with exclusive male parental care and terrestrial eggs transport. We examined the variations of body temperature of egg-carrying males and non-reproductive individuals in the field, and determined their thermal preferences in a laboratory thermal gradient. We also experimentally examined the influence of temperature on embryonic development durations across five treatments (16, 18, 20, 22, 24 degrees C). In support of our predictions, we detected a shift in thermal preferences with reproduction, with carrying males preferring higher temperatures than non-carrying ones. Field monitoring indicated that carrying males used diurnal shelters early in the season when thermal conditions were more constraining. Meanwhile, they minimized overheating risks by avoiding shelters with high substrate temperature. Finally, we detected a marked thermal dependence of embryonic development, suggesting potential phenological benefits of paternal thermoregulation in this species. Significance statement Paternal thermal care is well known among birds during incubation but male thermal care and thermal effects remain virtually unstudied among terrestrial ectotherms. In ectotherms, body temperature directly depends on the thermal environment and behavioral thermoregulation can influence developmental durations and offspring traits. We studied the midwife toad, a species that display exclusive male parental care with terrestrial egg transport. Our results demonstrate that carrying males selected preferred higher temperatures than non-reproductive individuals in a thermal gradient but also avoided thermal extreme in the field. The duration of development was considerably shortened at the temperature selected by reproductive male.

At an interspecific level, we found that brood desertion was less frequent in the species that nested earlier (red-crested pochard), while it was more frequent in the species that nested later (white-headed duck). Larger (older) ducklings were deserted more frequently than smaller ones in the three species. However, an interaction between flooding conditions in wetlands and species identity on brood desertion, after accounting for chick age, suggests that there were variations between the ducklings of the three species in their requirements for maternal care, conditioned by environmental conditions. Therefore, our study indicates that environmental conditions may affect parental care.

While prolactin underlies many parental behaviors in birds, its effects on other reproductive behaviors, such as courtship, remain unstudied. How prolactin affects neuropeptide and hormone receptor expression across the avian HPG axis also remains unknown. To address these questions, we administered ovine prolactin (oPRL) or a vehicle control to both sexes in experienced pairs of the biparental rock dove (Columba livia), after nest removal at the end of incubation. We found that oPRL promoted parental responses to novel chicks and stimulated crop growth compared to controls, consistent with other studies. However, we found that neither courtship behaviors, copulation rates nor pair maintenance differed with oPRL treatment. Across the HPG, we found oPRL had little effect on gene expression in hypothalamic nuclei, but increased expression of FSHB and hypothalamic hormone receptor genes in the pituitary. In the gonads, oPRL increased testes size and gonadotropin receptor expression, but did not affect ovarian state or small white follicle gene expression. However, the oviducts of oPRL-treated females were smaller and had lower estrogen receptor expression compared with controls. Our results highlight that some species, especially those that show multiple brooding, may continue to express mating behavior despite elevated prolactin.

Although it is now known that most traits are a product of both heredity (nature) and the environment (nurture), these two driving forces of trait development are rarely examined together. In birds, one important aspect of the early developmental environment is egg incubation temperature. Small changes (<1 degrees C) in incubation temperature can have large effects on a wide-array of offspring traits. One important trait is metabolism, because it is related to life-history traits and strategies, organismal performance, and energetic and behavioral strategies. Although it has been shown that embryonic and post-hatch metabolism are related to egg incubation temperature, little is known about how this may vary as a function of genetic differences or post-hatching environmental conditions. Here, we investigated this question in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). We experimentally incubated eggs at two different temperatures: 37.5 degrees C (control), which is optimal for this species and 36.3 degrees C (low), which is suboptimal. We first measured embryonic heart rate as a proxy of embryonic metabolic rate. Then, at hatch, we cross-fostered nestlings to differentiate genetic and pre-hatching factors from post-hatching environmental conditions. When offspring were 30 days-old, we measured their resting metabolic rate (RMR; within the thermoneutral zone) and thermoregulatory metabolic rate (TMR; 12 degrees C; birds must actively thermoregulate). We also measured RMR and TMR of all genetic and foster parents. We found that embryonic heart rate was greater in eggs incubated at the control temperature than those at the low temperature. Further, embryonic heart rate was positively related to genetic father RMR, suggesting that it is both heritable and affected by the pre-natal environment. In addition, we found that post-hatch metabolic rates were positively related to genetic parent metabolic rate, and interactively related to incubation temperature and foster mother metabolic rate. Altogether, this suggests that metabolism and the energetic cost of thermoregulation can be influenced by genetics, the pre-natal environment, and the post-natal environment.

Specifically, the extent to which dietary overlap within these communities may affect the conservation of target species has rarely been assessed. In Southern Europe, sites of large-scale nest-site provisioning aimed at recovering Lesser Kestrels Falco naumanni populations have attracted non-target bird species, resulting in mixed breeding assemblages that might promote interspecific competition for resources during breeding. Here we used stable isotope analysis (delta N-15 and delta C-13) to assess inter- and intraspecific dietary segregation in these assemblages and investigate the mechanisms allowing species coexistence. We examined resource partitioning and trophic niche overlap among Lesser Kestrels, Common Kestrels Falco tinnunculus, European Rollers Coracias garrulus, Western Barn Owls Tyto alba, Little Owls Athene noctua and Spotless Starlings Sturnus unicolor; and within species between parents and their offspring. Similar isotope ratios and highly overlapped niches, particularly among Lesser Kestrels, Rollers and Starlings, suggest limited dietary segregation and use of similar prey. Within species, parent-offspring segregation was marked across all species. Our results indicate that species breeding in these assemblages occupy similar ecological niches, despite a potential increase in competition. High resource availability in the area may permit coexistence but the viability of mixed-species groups may be compromised in areas with limited resources, which are predicted to expand with ongoing human- and climate-induced changes.

Birds perform long-distance and energetically expensive trips between foraging and breeding grounds. We describe how Grey Gulls modify nest attendance and chick provisioning strategies from an unusual coastal colony established at Playa Brava, northern Chile, during the 2017-2018 season. Contrary to what it is usually observed in desert colonies, incubating, and brooding Grey Gulls at Playa Brava relieved mates at the nest regularly and fed chicks several times throughout the day. Some adults even left their chicks unattended at the nest to forage on the nearby shoreline (<0.15 km) for a variable amount of time (up to 57 min) before returning to resume brooding. These behaviours are likely to ease parental duties by allowing multiple pair changeovers, reduce energy expenditure by avoiding extensive trips between the desert and the coast, increase chick growth rates by allowing multiple meals during the day, among other advantages.

Investigating heritability as well as parental effects and rearing environment can help us to understand the factors affecting offspring telomeres. Moreover, how phenotypic parental traits linked with fitness can impact offspring RTL is still unclear. A phenotypic marker closely associated with physiological traits and fitness is melanin-based color polymorphism, which in tawny owl (Strix aluco) is highly heritable and strongly associated with adult telomere shortening and survival. We studied narrow-sense heritability (h(2)) of RTL, as well as the impact of parental age and color morph and their interaction on offspring RTL. Offspring RTL at fledging was strongly positively correlated with both mother RTL and father RTL at breeding. Offspring RTL was also negatively associated with father age, suggesting that older fathers sired offspring with shorter telomeres. Parental color morph did not explain offspring RTL, and there were no interactive effects of parental morph and age, despite previously documented morph-specific senescence patterns. Our results suggest that RTL is highly heritable and affected by paternal age but not related to color polymorphism. This suggests that either morph-specific telomere shortening as an adult does not result in significantly shorter telomeres in their gametes, or that parents compensate morph-specific senescence via parental care.

After the 2 robin young fledged, we did not observe any crossover post-fledging care.

Many hosts of brood parasites are long-distance migrants, spending significant proportions of annual cycles at different sites around the world, which makes correct timing of particular events within these cycles of utmost importance. Nevertheless, conditions in a given phase of the annual cycle may influence the timing of the following phases via carry-over effects. Here, we explored whether great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) parents fostering a brood-parasitic common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) were delayed on departure from the breeding site and arrival at the wintering sites compared to the parents caring for own nestlings. Additionally, we tested whether the parents with nestlings hatched later in the season set out for autumn migration and arrived at the wintering sites later than the parents with nestlings hatched earlier in the season and whether female parents lagged in time behind male parents during autumn migration. We found that the parents fostering the common cuckoo were delayed neither on departure from the breeding site nor on arrival at the wintering sites compared to the parents rearing own nestlings. Moreover, there was no effect of hatching date and parent sex on the timing of autumn migration. Future studies may rather focus on tracking female parents which could be more affected by the care for a brood parasite than male parents. Future researchers may also strive to monitor post-fledging survival of young, as increased mortality of either the brood-parasitic or host fledglings could affect the end of host parental care and thus also the timing of host autumn migration.",2022,163,417,423,,10.1007/s10336-021-01949-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-021-01949-y,0,,,,

Parents can adjust the feeding rate of nestlings by their response to begging calls. Acoustics play an important role in parent-offspring communication. When adults perceive predators, they can make mobbing alarm calls to warn other individuals. Chicks can also respond to the alarm calls of parents and thus reduce their predation risk. We tested whether the chicks of two species could hear, and respond to, conspecific and heterospecific acoustic alarm signals. Chicks were found to eavesdrop on conspecific and heterospecific mobbing alarm calls. Acoustical similarities between the alarm calls may explain why chicks can recognize heterospecific calls. Predation is generally the main cause of bird mortality. Birds can use acoustic signals to increase their predation survival. Bird response to mobbing alarm calls is a form of anti-predation behavior. We used a playback technique and acoustic analysis to study the function of mobbing alarm calls in the parent-offspring communication of two sympatric birds, the vinous throated parrotbill (Sinosuthora webbianus) and oriental reed warbler (Acrocephalus orientalis). The chicks of these two species responded to conspecific and heterospecific mobbing alarm calls by suppressing their begging behavior. The mobbing alarm calls in these two species were similar. Mobbing alarm calls play an important role in parent-offspring communication, and chicks can eavesdrop on heterospecific alarm calls to increase their own survival. Eavesdropping behavior and the similarity of alarm call acoustics suggest that the evolution of alarm calls is conservative and favors sympatric birds that have coevolved to use the same calls to reduce predation risk.",2022,12,,,2156,10.3390/ani12162156,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani12162156,0,,,,

As such, abandonment of the current reproductive attempt may benefit potential future opportunities, maximising lifetime reproductive success. Obligate brood parasitism, a reproductive strategy in which parasites lay their eggs in the nests of other species and rely solely on them to raise the parasitic young, is an ideal system to study brood abandonment. Some parasitised host species have evolved anti-parasitic defences, notably clutch abandonment (egg burial and nest desertion), that may mitigate negative consequences of parasitism. Abandonment of clutches due to parasitism is not unlike abandonment of reproduction in times of stress, suggesting that host responses to parasitism could be triggered at least partly by elevated stress hormones that mediate individual decisions. Yet, the mechanistic basis for clutch abandonment remains unclear. Here, we experimentally parasitised clutches of yellow warblers (Setophaga petechia), a common host of the brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater), with model cowbird eggs to examine whether host circulating corticosterone (CORT) differed among females that accepted parasitic eggs or rejected them through clutch abandonment. We also assessed whether feather CORT, a measure of past corticosterone exposure, differed between accepters and abandoners. Finally, we investigated whether egg visual signals, specifically differences in maculation characteristics between model cowbird and host eggs, predicted abandonment of experimentally parasitised clutches. Circulating CORT was higher in females who abandoned their parasitised clutches, but not in those who accepted, relative to controls with no egg addition. Past stress and differences in maculation characteristics did not predict whether individuals accepted or abandoned experimentally parasitised clutches. Moreover, differences in maculation characteristics between the host and model cowbird eggs did not predict CORT levels or nest abandonment. Thus, parasitism with subsequent clutch abandonment may be associated with elevated circulating CORT, but neither past stress nor differences in maculation characteristics influenced abandonment. The combination of these results contributes to our understanding of the roles of corticosterone and egg visual signals in the context of clutch abandonment in brood parasitism specifically, and of parental care more broadly.",2022,10,,,711732,10.3389/fevo.2022.711732,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2022.711732,0,,,,

We continuously recorded nests (one block of up to 24 h per nest) of two ground-nesting shorebirds, the Red-capped Plover Charadrius ruficapillus and Masked Lapwing Vanellus miles and quantified parental behaviours. We predict an increase in egg thermoregulation behaviours (time spent incubating or shading) and 'fussing' (a combination of rising and re-settling, shuffling, orientation change and egg turning) when vocalizations were naturally present or when they were experimentally introduced in comparison to when no vocalizations were present (control). In Lapwings, the rate of fussing increased at the nest only when natural vocalizations were present; however, preening increased when natural or introduced vocalizations were present. Additionally, the frequency of bill to egg touches (inspections) increased only in the presence of introduced vocalizations. For Plovers, treatment had no influence on parental behavioural; however, the frequency of fussing, bill to egg touches and shell tossing increased with air temperature. For both species, there was no influence of the presence of the embryo's vocalizations (natural or introduced) on the parent's egg thermoregulation behaviours.

In altricial birds, a top cause of reproductive failure is nest predation, and alarm calls both by parents and chicks can serve to alert others and increase the likelihood of offspring escaping predation. Understanding the factors that determine the strength of parental antipredator responses to different nestling alarm calls can provide insight into parent-offspring recognition. The prothonotary warbler (Protonotaria citrea), a host of the obligate brood parasite, the brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater), never rejects cowbird young and raises the parasite together with its own offspring. To determine whether warbler parents learn cowbird nestling alarm calls, we presented experimentally parasitized or non-parasitized parents with playbacks of conspecific warbler, parasitic cowbird, and a harmless heterospecific control, eastern bluebird (Sialis sialis), nestling alarm calls. We recorded the latency to respond and the number of chips given by members of the resident warbler pair. We found that parents were most likely to respond to warbler nestling alarm calls, least likely to respond to bluebird calls, with a statistically intermediate likelihood of responding to cowbird calls. Critically, current and past parasitism status did not affect the likelihood of response to any playback or the number of chips given, however, currently parasitized parents had greater response latencies to playbacks than non-parasitized parents. These results suggest that warbler parents do not learn cowbird alarm calls from breeding experiences and, in turn, that cowbirds may employ a generalized, bet-hedging alarm call.",2022,25,1289,1298,,10.1007/s10071-022-01612-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10071-022-01612-w,0,,,,

Extreme weather events can have high biological impacts and are becoming more frequent recently. In cities, the urban heat island can amplify the intensity and frequency of hot weather events. However, the joint effects of heat events and urban microclimate on wildlife are unclear, as urban populations may either suffer more from increased heat stress or may adapt to tolerate warmer temperatures. Here, we test whether the effects of hot weather on reproductive success of great tits (Parus major) are exacerbated or dampened in urban environments compared to forest habitats. By studying 760 broods from two urban and two forest populations over 6 years, we show that 14-16 days-old nestlings have smaller body mass and tarsus length, and suffer increased mortality when they experience a higher number of hot days during the nestling period. The negative effects of hot weather on body mass and survival are significantly stronger in forests than in urban areas, where these effects are dampened or even reversed. These results suggest that urban nestlings are less vulnerable to extreme hot weather conditions than their non-urban conspecifics. This difference might be the result of adaptations that facilitate heat dissipation, including smaller body size, altered plumage and reduced brood size. Alternatively or additionally, parental provisioning and food availability may be less affected by heat in urban areas.

We tested whether experimental exposure to chronic traffic noise affected parental behaviour and reproductive success in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). In a counterbalanced repeated-measures design, breeding pairs were exposed to continuous playback of one of two types of highway noise previously shown to be either neutral (control) or aversive. Parental nest attendance positively correlated with feeding effort and was higher for the aversive than the control sound and this effect was more pronounced for parents attending larger broods. However, neither noise condition affected offspring number, growth or body mass. The absence of an effect held when we combined our data with data from two other comparable studies into a meta-analysis.

Here, however, we demonstrate its regular occurrence in two European populations of the Eurasian hoopoe (Upupa epops) and explore possible adaptive and non-adaptive explanations. Results showed that sibling cannibalism was more frequently detected in Spain (51.7%) than in Austria (5.9%). In these two populations, the hoopoes laid similar clutch sizes, resulting in similar fledging production, but hatching failures were more frequent in the northern population. Consequently, having more nestlings condemned to die in the southern population may explain the higher incidence of sibling cannibalism. In accordance with this interpretation, hatching span and failure, but not breeding date, explained the probability of sibling cannibalism in the Spanish hoopoes, while all three variables predicted brood reduction intensity. Furthermore, experimental food supply reduced the probability of sibling cannibalism, but not the intensity of brood reduction. Finally, females allocated fewer resources to the smallest nestlings when they were going to starve, but not necessarily when they were going to be used as food for their siblings. These results suggest that hoopoes produce extra eggs that, in the case of reduced hatching failure and food scarcity, produce nestlings that are used to feed older siblings. These findings provide the first evidence that sibling cannibalism occurs regularly in a bird species, thus expanding our evolutionary understanding of clutch size, hatching asynchrony, parent-offspring conflict, infanticide, and sibling cannibalism in the animal kingdom.",2022,43,265,274,,10.24272/j.issn.2095-8137.2021.434,http://dx.doi.org/10.24272/j.issn.2095-8137.2021.434,0,,,,

It has been demonstrated that many hosts have evolved an ability to recognize and reject parasitic eggs, based on differences in egg patterns, as a defense against brood parasitism, while some parasites have evolved egg mimicry to counter the host defense. Egg pattern is a complex phenotype and its quantitative evaluation has been a focus of much research. In this paper, we propose a novel method for quantifying an egg pattern and assessing the degree of egg pattern mimicry- a measure of the similarity of a parasite egg to host eggs. Our approach is based on image analysis focused on local binary pattern (LBP) and its variant completed local binary pattern (CLBP) that captures the local structure of a pattern in an image. We compare the results obtained by LBP and CLBP with human-eye evaluation, a classical method widely used in previous studies. Both LBP and CLBP can successfully assess the similarity in egg pattern that is positively correlated with human-eye scores with a high accuracy rate. LBP tends to perform better than CLBP at small scales while CLBP performs better for a wide range of larger scales. Our method can be an effective alternative means of assessing the degree of egg pattern mimicry objectively, providing a useful tool for biologists studying avian brood parasitism. Many bird species have specific eggshell patterns (e.g. spots, blotches, lines) and it has been suggested that these patterns are an important functional trait, such as for camouflage against predators.

Because parental behaviors can attract the attention of nest predators, incubating birds are predicted to decrease conspicuous behaviors at the nest-site and increase incubation constancy when risks of nest predation are high. We examined whether snowy plovers Charadrius nivosus responded to predator-specific risks of nest predation, using the number of off bouts and daily nest attendance (proportion of time spent incubating) as responses. We quantified risks using predator-specific hazard rates of nest mortality, which varied daily and were based on habitat characteristics at each nest. We assessed the influence of predator-specific risks of nest mortality on incubation behaviors using an individual-centering approach, allowing us to explain variation in incubation behaviors within- and among-breeding pairs. We found increased number of off bouts and nest attendance within-breeding pairs in response to increasing risks of nest predation by foxes (Vulpes spp.) and gulls (Larus spp.), but not coyotes (Canis latrans) and common ravens (Corvus corax). Among breeding pairs across habitats, we found increased nest attendance in response to higher risks of nest predation by foxes, but not coyotes, gulls, or ravens. Breeding pairs differed in the amount of behavioral plasticity they exhibited in response to risks of nest predation. Our results suggest that risks of nest predation differentially influence behavioral responses of snowy plovers depending on the predator species, and the amount of behavioral plasticity may depend on the characteristics of breeding adults. Hide How do nesting birds balance trade-offs between the needs of their offspring and themselves, particularly when predators exert varying risks? We show that snowy plovers, a shorebird species where both sexes incubate their nest, vary their incubation behaviors with risks of nest predation by some, but not all nest predator species.

However, shared benefits and individual costs also give rise to conflict among carers conflict among carers over investment. Coordination of provisioning visits has been hypothesized to facilitate the resolution of this conflict, preventing exploitation, and ensuring collective investment in the shared brood. We used a 26-year study of long-tailed tits, Aegithalos caudatus, a facultative cooperative breeder, to investigate whether care by parents and helpers is coordinated, whether there are consistent differences in coordination between individuals and reproductive roles, and whether coordination varies with helper relatedness to breeders. Coordination takes the form of turn-taking (alternation) or feeding within a short time interval of another carer (synchrony), and both behaviors were observed to occur more than expected by chance, that is, active coordination. First, we found that active alternation decreased with group size, whereas active synchrony occurred at all group sizes. Second, we show that alternation was repeatable between observations at the same nest, whereas synchrony was repeatable between observations of the same individual. Active synchrony varied with reproductive status, with helpers synchronizing visits more than breeders, although active alternation did not vary with reproductive status. Finally, we found no significant effect of relatedness on either alternation or synchrony exhibited by helpers. In conclusion, we demonstrate active coordination of provisioning by carers and conclude that coordination is a socially plastic behavior depending on reproductive status and the number of carers raising the brood. Individuals raising a shared brood prefer other carers to invest more than themselves, resulting in conflict over each carer's investment. We investigated whether this conflict might be mitigated by coordinating visits. We found that long-tailed tits coordinate their care, taking turns to feed chicks and synchronizing arrivals at nests.

The role of cosmetic coloration has traditionally been focused in scenarios of sexual selection, but it could also take place in other contexts. Here, by using spotless starlings (Sturnus unicolor) as a model system, we explore the possibility that nestlings cosmetically use their intensely yellow-colored uropygial secretion to signal their genetic and/or phenotypic quality. In agreement with the hypothetical cosmetic use of the uropygial secretion, (i) video recorded nestlings collected secretion with the bill at the age of feathering, (ii) cotton swabs turned to the color of secretion after rubbing with them nestlings' gape, and (iii) gape and skin colorations correlated positively with that of secretion. Furthermore, we found that (iv) secretion coloration has a genetic component, and (v) associated positively with Vitamin E supplementation and (vi) with plasma carotenoid concentration, which highlights the informative value of nestling secretion. Finally, (vii) coloration of begging-related traits and of secretion of nestlings predicted parental feeding preferences. Consequently, all these results strongly suggest that the cosmetic use of colored uropygial secretion might also play a role in parent-offspring communication, complementing or amplifying information provided by the flamboyant colored gapes and skin of nestlings. The use of makeups by offspring for communication with relatives has been scarcely explored and we hope that these results will encourage further investigations in birds and other taxa with parental care. Spotless starling nestlings colour their mouths with a yellow secretion that reflects their oxidative status, which in turn influences parental feeding behaviour. We directly observed the cosmetic use of uropigial secretion by nestlings and experimentally demonstrated a link between antioxidants and secretion colour.

For multi-brooded organisms with short breeding seasons, such as migratory passerines, repeated nest construction could be especially costly if the activity delays the onset of breeding attempts. Earlier studies on passerines that reuse nests between breeding seasons suggested that time lost to initial nest construction reduces seasonal reproductive output. However, costs associated with building new nests between breeding attempts, within the same breeding season, have largely been ignored. Here, we experimentally removed first nests, after fledging or failing, of Eastern Phoebes (Sayornis phoebe), to evaluate how the annual onset of breeding and nest construction between breeding attempts affected parental investment into second attempts.

Neither first egg laying date nor treatment statistically influenced any of the reproductive traits in second breeding attempts (clutch size, nestling body condition, and nestling growth rate).

Drivers of declines may also influence the overall abundance and spatial distribution of insects within agricultural landscapes. Subsequently, the food provisioning rate of birds breeding within more agro-intensive landscapes may be impacted. Lower provisioning rates in agro-intensive landscapes may lead not only to reduced growth rate, body condition, or fledging success of nestlings but also to diminished body condition of food provisioning adults. Results from a previous study supported this hypothesis as the fledging success and proxies of nestling body condition were lowest for an aerial insectivore breeding in more agro-intensive landscapes. Of the multiple hypotheses put forward to explain these correlations, one mechanism may act through variation in food provisioning rates. In this study, we expounded on this hypothesis using data derived from the aforementioned study system and assessed if provisioning rates to nestlings and food provisioning behavior of adults varied across a gradient of agricultural intensification in a declining aerial insectivore, the Tree Swallow (Tachycineta bicolor). We found that the hourly provisioning rate was lower in agro-intensive landscapes, and yet travel distances were longest within less agro-intensive landscapes. Our results highlight that, in order to maximize long-term average gain rates, Tree Swallows breeding within agro-intensive landscapes must forage with greater intensity, perhaps at a cost to themselves, or else costs will transfer to growing broods. Our work provides further evidence that agricultural intensification on the breeding grounds can contribute to the declines of aerial insectivores in part through a trophic pathway.",2022,13,,,e4227,10.1002/ecs2.4227,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4227,1,1,1,,1

Such investigations usually focus on a time window when the studied activity is performed, often neglecting how the time devoted to focal activity affects time allocation to following-up behaviours, while that may have its own fitness consequences. In this study, we examined time allocation into three post-foraging activities (entering the nest with food, nest attendance, and colony attendance) in a small seabird species, the little auk (Alle alle). Since little auks alternate foraging trips of different duration (short and long) and purpose (offspring feeding and primarily self-feeding, respectively) we expected that duration of the following up in-colony activities would also vary, being longer after a long absence in the colony (because of greater need of reassessment of the current predation pressure and social interactions in the colony, and re-establishing the bond with the offspring and/or partner and/or neighbours after longer absence). We found that it was not always the case, as time allocation of the post-foraging in-colony activities was primarily year- and sex-specific. It highlights the need to consider year and sex effects in studies of behavioural ecology, as not doing so may lead to spurious conclusions. Interestingly, and despite a great inter-individual variation in time allocation in the post-foraging in-colony activities, little auk individuals were quite repeatable in their behavioural performance, which suggests these activities may reflect birds behavioural profile. Overall, post-foraging in-colony activity of the little auk, although not much dependent on duration/type of the preceding foraging flights, varies with respect to year and sex, and as such may be a proxy of behavioural plasticity of the population.",2022,12,,,12981,10.1038/s41598-022-17307-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-17307-8,0,,,,

However, in species with extreme hatching asynchrony, the last hatchlings paradoxically experience a very low probability of survival and death can take so long that it can hardly be considered an adaptation. Here, we propose and experimentally tested a new adaptive hypothesis explaining the brood reduction paradox, namely the Male Manipulation Hypothesis. Our hypothesis suggests that by inducing asynchronous hatching, females increase the feeding requirements of the brood, which will induce males to increase provisioning effort. In addition, females may extend the period of male manipulation by feeding the smallest nestling just enough to sustain life. Our study showed that male common blackbirds (Turdus merula) increased their effort (i.e., number of food items per hour) in experimental asynchronous broods compared to synchronous broods, while females reduced their contribution, as predicted by the hypothesis.",2022,43,843,850,,10.24272/j.issn.2095-8137.2021.455,http://dx.doi.org/10.24272/j.issn.2095-8137.2021.455,1,1,1,,1
2022-75,"Kloskowski, J",High pair fidelity despite sex differences in the duration of parental care in a long-lived migratory bird,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,"In monogamous birds, pair bond maintenance is often dependent on previous breeding success and each parent's effort, because partners gain information about one another's quality and contribution to brood rearing. The asymmetries between mates in parental investment have been theoretically linked to a sexual conflict of interests. Year-to-year pair fidelity decisions in relation to birds' previous-year information about their mates, including territory quality and relative length of brood care, were explored in red-necked grebes (Podiceps grisegena), a long-lived species with parent-fed young. Overall, mate retention was a major strategy (81.5% of pair-years). The probability of breakage/maintenance of a pair bond was not affected by previous-year hatching success, fledgling production, or territory quality in terms of food abundance for chicks. Reunited pairs bred earlier in the season than new pairs. In pairs that maintained bonds into the subsequent season, females typically terminated care 1-4 weeks before males. The male fidelity indicates that earlier brood abandonment by females may confer some fitness benefits to males and reflect coordination of reproductive effort at the behavioural level rather than exploitation of one partner by another. Significance statement Pair-living animals deciding whether to keep their old mate for future breeding usually consider their previous reproductive success and the partner's effort. In some monogamous birds, often one of the parents leaves the brood before its mate, which is usually explained in terms of conflict between the sexes over parental care costs. I studied links between previous year's parental effort and mate retention in red-necked grebes, a long-lived waterbird. Grebes showed high pair fidelity irrespective of recent breeding success. In pairs that stayed together, females typically terminated brood care earlier than their mates. The male fidelity indicates that the unequal duration of brood attendance can be interpreted as cooperation and not conflict, especially as departing females did not attempt a second brood, while male-only care after female departure was sufficient to raise the young.",2022,76,,,45,10.1007/s00265-022-03156-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-022-03156-y,0,,,,

In cooperative breeders, helpers also provide care by feeding the young. However, how helpers of different sex and relatedness to the offspring respond to begging behaviour has rarely been studied in cooperatively breeding species, which limits our understanding of the indirect and/or direct benefits that helpers may obtain by responding to offspring demand. Here, we used a cooperatively breeding bird, the sociable weaver, Philetairus socius, to investigate how nest intervisit intervals of breeders and different types of helpers, distinguished by sex and relatedness, varied with acoustic begging. Moreover, we tested whether these different classes of provisioners experienced distinct levels of begging. Our results show that only breeding males, but not breeding females or helpers of any sex and relatedness to the nestlings, returned faster to the nest to feed after experiencing more begging calls. When contrasted directly, we confirmed a statistically supported difference in responses to begging between male and female breeders. Surprisingly, second-order relatives experienced more begging calls than the other classes of more related helpers and breeders. These results show that we might find differences in how provisioners respond to begging levels when classifying group members according to their potential fitness gains. In sociable weavers, the benefits and costs of adjusting feeding efforts to begging seem to differ with sex and life history stage. Experimental and more detailed investigations on begging-feeding interactions are necessary to understand the origin and prevalence of these differences across cooperatively breeding systems.

Understanding the physiological aspects behind their nesting behaviour is imperative to improve our knowledge about behavioural mechanisms focusing on species conservation. Nevertheless, current knowledge on fish nesting is still underexplored. Here, we show a synthesis based on an integrative approach for understanding the diversity of nesting behaviour in fish. Because a nest sometimes does not involve new buildings (as in birds), we suggest a more comprehensive definition based on the behaviour instead of the structure per se. Forty fish families were recorded as they made nests, which were sorted into six main types: bowls, burrows, foam nests, nests made of plant matter and animal parts, besides nests made on clean rock surfaces. Besides spawning and parental care, these nests also serve as a refuge against predators and male competitors, as targets for sexual selection, including bowers with no parental care function, and badges of social status. We showed that, although it is advantageous to what the Darwinian fitness of the species is concerned, nesting also requires time and energy. We propose an evolution of nest types and functions, from the ancestral bowl used as refuge to derived foam nests with sexual selection functions. Physiologically, nesting is controlled by the HPG axis and particular brain circuits, this probably being the less explored subject. Finally, we highlighted that, in the changing world of the Anthropocene, nesting behaviour emerges as a framework to indicate the quality of the aquatic environments.",2022,23,564,583,,10.1111/faf.12632,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/faf.12632,0,,,,

This hypothesis makes two predictions: within populations, females should engage with more dissimilar/heterozygous males and, among populations, females should pursue more frequently EPP in populations characterized by a lower genetic variability and a higher homozygosity. However, support is still unclear throughout literature, and usually involves the study of a single population. We compared a peripheral population of rock sparrow Petronia petronia living at the marginal distribution of the species and characterized by a high EPP level (> 50%) (Italian Alps) with a population located in the centre of the species' distribution (central Spain), to understand if variations in EPP could be linked to differences in mean heterozygosity and genetic similarity both between and within populations. EPP in the Spanish population was 18.1%, three times lower than that observed in the Alpine one (51.2%), and this difference remained fairly constant across different years. Supporting the between populations prediction, we found lower heterozygosity and reduced allelic richness in the Alpine population compared to the Spanish one. In contrast, social and extra-pair males, as well as within and extra-pair offspring, did not significantly differ in terms of genetic similarity and heterozygosity within brood in either population. Social and extra-pair males did not differ in tarsus size, body weight or yellow badge size, suggesting that females were not choosing extra-pair partners based on heterozygosity, genetic similarity or phenotypic quality.

The abundances of generalist predators have been positively associated with the abundance of gamebirds. These relationships have implications for prey populations, with the potential for indirect impacts of gamebird releases on wider biodiversity. To understand the basis of these associations, we investigated variation in territory size, prey provisioning to chicks, and breeding success of common buzzards Buteo buteo, and associations with variation in the abundances of free-roaming gamebirds, primarily pheasants Phasianus colchicus, and of rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus and field voles Microtus agrestis, as important prey for buzzards. The relative abundance of gamebirds, but not those of rabbits or voles, was weakly but positively correlated with our index of buzzard territory size. Gamebirds were rarely brought to the nest. Rabbits and voles, and not gamebirds, were provisioned to chicks in proportion to their relative abundance. The number of buzzard chicks increased with provisioning rates of rabbits, in terms of both provisioning frequency and biomass, but not with provisioning rates for gamebirds or voles. Associations between the abundances of buzzards and gamebirds may not be a consequence of the greater availability of gamebirds as prey during the buzzard breeding season. Instead, the association may arise either from habitat or predator management leading to higher densities of alternative prey (in this instance, rabbits), or from greater availability of gamebirds as prey or carrion during the autumn and winter shooting season. The interactions between gamebird releases and associated practices of predator control and shooting itself require better understanding to more effectively intervene in any one aspect of this complex social-ecological system.",2022,12,,,e8877,10.1002/ece3.8877,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.8877,0,,,,

Changes in circulating hormones that underlie reproductive behaviors, including prolactin, have been found to correlate with parental experience in birds and mammals. Altered responsiveness to prolactin in key behavioral centers of the brain may also underlie the effects of experience on parental behaviors. Further, experience may also affect responsiveness to prolactin stimulatory hormones, such as hypothalamic vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). While experience has been shown to upregulate neural prolactin receptors and responsiveness in rodents, its effects on prolactin receptor gene expression remain unstudied in birds. To address this, we examined gene expression of pituitary prolactin, hypothalamic prolactin receptors in the preoptic area, hypothalamic VIP, and pituitary VIP receptors in both sexes of the biparental rock dove (Columba livia) when birds were not actively nesting. As age and parental experience are often confounded (i.e.,experienced parents tend to be older than their inexperienced counterparts), we measured gene expression in birds of varying combinations of age (0.6-3 years) and prior reproductive experience (0-12 chicks raised). We found that increasing experience with chicks correlated with lower PRLR expression in the preoptic area, and age correlated with lower VIP expression in birds of both sexes. Pituitary PRL and VIPR expression was not associated with parental experience or age.

Studies of maternal steroid effects, especially rich in mammals and birds, have offered exciting insights into the evolution of maternal effects in vertebrates. To extend this literature, we quantified levels of steroids in the eggs of four neotropical dendrobatid frogs that lay terrestrial clutches, a reproductive strategy that has evolved multiple times in amphibians. Building on our observational results, we then manipulated levels of pregnenolone and progesterone in eggs of one species and examined how this affected steroid levels during development. Eggs of all four species had detectable steroids levels, with progestogens being more abundant than androgens and glucocorticoids. Estrogens could not be detected. Immersion of frog eggs in a solution containing pregnenolone and progesterone resulted in elevated levels of both steroids early in development, but levels declined and were similar to those in unmanipulated eggs by the end of development. Treated eggs also exhibited a transient increase in levels of steroids that can be produced from pregnenolone and progesterone. Overall, our findings demonstrate that frog eggs contain steroids similar to what has been observed in other egg-laying vertebrates.

Measuring body mass can therefore help researchers understand how and why animals make decisions relating to their behavior. center dot We measured changes in body mass during incubation for the Manx Shearwater (Puffinus puffinus), a seabird species in which both parents care for the offspring. We were interested in how the maintenance of body mass relates to parental behavior, whether this differs between males and females, and whether parents behave cooperatively. center dot We found that shearwaters determined their foraging trip durations during incubation based on a combination of their own body mass and that of the partner, providing evidence that parents factor their partner's condition into their decisions. For many bird species, trade-offs in resource allocation become stark during incubation, when caring demands put into direct conflict their investment in reproduction versus survival. We demonstrate the critical importance of resource allocation, here measured indirectly as body mass, for incubation behavior in the Manx Shearwater (Puffinus puffinus), a biparentally-caring seabird. Using daily measurements of body mass from breeding pairs in combination with field observations and remotely collected behavioral data, we examined how changes in mass related to nest attendance and foraging behavior. We furthermore tested whether this differed between the sexes and between pairs of different breeding experience. We found that while body mass predicted the probability that incubating birds would choose to temporarily desert the nest, incubation shift duration was ultimately set by return of the foraging bird. The trip durations of foraging birds in turn were primarily dictated by their body mass reserves on departure from the nest. However, foragers appeared to account for the condition of the incubating partner by returning from sea earlier when their partner was in poor condition. This key finding suggests that decisions relating to resource allocation may be made cooperatively within the breeding pair during incubation.

How birds cope with this challenge has been little studied. In this study, we compared the provisioning behavior and nestling condition of the Green-backed Tit Parus monticolus nesting in a landscape mosaic comprised of native mixed-oak forests and exotic Japanese Cedar Cryptomeria japonica plantations. Parent birds in the larvae-poor plantations time their breeding as they do in the larvae-rich forests and have clutches of similar size. We found that parent birds were flexible in adjusting their criteria for prey choice on the basis of larval abundance. In early spring, in cedar plantations where larval abundance was low, male parents maintained constant nearby feeding trips to the early broods, just as they did in the mixed-oak forests, but reduced their dietary specialization on larvae, while female birds increased their provisioning frequency. Combining both parents' efforts, the early brood nestlings raised in the cedar plantations received food deliveries more frequently and with a higher proportion of non-larval prey than their counterparts did in the mixed-oak forests. In contrast, during late brood rearing, when larvae were abundant, both parents in the plantations foraged heavily on larvae at the expense of other prey, just as they did in the mixed-oak forests. We found that parent birds reared heavier nestlings as the contribution of large larvae to the diet increased. Moreover, the nestlings during early broods in the plantations had lower body weights than their counterparts in the mixed-oak forests. We suggest that the provisioning flexibility of Green-backed Tits helps them gather food for raising nestlings when their breeding attempts are less synchronized with the larval food supply in their habitat. As a result, they can breed successfully in the exotic cedar plantations.",2022,21,165,176,,,,1,1,1,,1

Many migratory species have advanced the phenology of important life history stages and, as a result, are likely to be exposed to these periods of inclement spring weather more often, therefore risking reduced fitness and population growth. For declining avian species, including aerial insectivores, anthropogenic landscape changes such as agricultural intensification are another driver of population declines. These landscape changes may affect the foraging ability of food provisioning parents and reduce the survival of nestlings exposed to inclement weather through, for example, pesticide exposure impairing thermoregulation and punctual anorexia. Breeding in agro-intensive landscapes may therefore exacerbate the negative effects of inclement weather under climate change. We observed that a significant reduction in the availability of insect prey occurred when daily maximum temperatures fell below 18.3 degrees C, and thereby defined any day when the maximum temperature fell below this value as a day witnessing a cold snap. We then combined daily information on the occurrence of cold snaps and measures of precipitation to assess their impact on the fledging success of Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) occupying a nest box system placed across a gradient of agricultural intensification. Estimated fledging success of this declining aerial insectivore was 36.2% lower for broods experiencing 4 cold-snap days during the 12 days post-hatching period versus broods experiencing none, and this relationship was worsened when facing more precipitation. We further found that the overall negative effects of a brood experiencing periods of inclement weather was exacerbated in more agro-intensive landscapes.

Here, we used mini-GPS loggers, habitat suitability models, and stable isotopes to assess sex differences in the foraging movements, spatial distribution, and trophic ecology of Boyd's shearwaters Puffinus lherminieri boydi in Raso Islet (16 degrees 36' N, 24 degrees 35' W), Cabo Verde, during the chick-rearing periods of 2018-2019. The existence of sexual foraging segregation was tested in short (< 1 day) and in long trips (>= 1 day). Females engaged in slightly longer and more distant foraging trips, reaching northerly regions when compared to males, although sex differences were more pronounced during short trips. Spatial overlap within and between sexes was low, indicating a sex-specific pattern, albeit slight, in the foraging behaviour and spatial distribution of adult breeders. Habitat suitability models revealed a higher contribution of sea surface temperature and height for short and long trips, respectively, and regardless of sex. Stable isotope analysis revealed that both sexes occupied similar isotopic niches and the mixing model revealed no diet differences. In the absence of sexual size dimorphism, these findings may indicate that differential energetic demands may not manifest in strong differences in foraging behaviour or prey preferences, however, may be perceptible in differences in provisioning behaviour. Thus, it is possible that other factors involving distinct parental investment in chick-provisioning, such as the sensitivity to chick begging, could help explain the occurrence of sexual segregation in Boyd's shearwater.",2022,169,,,144,10.1007/s00227-022-04127-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-022-04127-7,1,1,0,interval length,

We sought to explain this by studying a multi-brooded population of Eastern Bluebirds (Sialia sialis) breeding in nest boxes. We examined seasonal change in nest weights and compared the weights of nests built by immigrant and resident females. We further investigated whether nest weight correlated with maternal condition or breeding success. Nest weight measured after broods fledged was correlated with nest height at the start of incubation. Breeders spent fewer days building and built successively smaller, lighter nests in later nesting attempts. Female bluebirds performed the majority of nest construction. Nests built by immigrant females were significantly larger on average than those built by female recruits hatched on site, and the seasonal decline in nest weight was more pronounced for natally philopatric females. For the first time, we present evidence that the weights of philopatric females' first nests were significantly positively correlated with the weights of the nests they were raised in, suggesting an effect of natal memory. Contrary to expectation, neither maternal condition nor reproductive success (clutch size, hatching success, brood size, and fledging success) was related to nest weight. To investigate whether smaller nests provided a thermal advantage in summer nest attempts when afternoon box temperatures can exceed 41 degrees C, we measured the temperature within nest boxes using programmable data loggers. Mean daily maximum box temperatures during incubation were significantly positively related to nest weight and significantly negatively related to the volume of free space above the nest. Increased air circulation above the nest likely contributed to cooling the boxes when ambient temperatures were high. Reducing nest size was therefore advantageous, especially in later nesting attempts when ambient temperatures were warmest. Seasonal decline in nest weights and differences between immigrant and natally philopatric females merits further investigation.",2022,15,100,112,,10.1177/17581559221092642,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/17581559221092642,0,,,,

However, predicting the temperatures at which reproductive performance is negatively impacted remains a significant hurdle. Using a thermoregulatory polygon approach, we derived a reproductive threshold temperature for an Arctic songbird-the snow bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis). We defined this threshold as the temperature at which individuals must reduce activity to suboptimal levels (i.e. less than four-time basal metabolic rate) to sustain nestling provisioning and avoid overheating. We then compared this threshold to operative temperatures recorded at high (82 degrees N) and low (64 degrees N) Arctic sites to estimate how heat constraints translate into site-specific impacts on sustained activity level. We predict buntings would become behaviourally constrained at operative temperatures above 11.7 degrees C, whereupon they must reduce provisioning rates to avoid overheating. Low-Arctic sites had larger fluctuations in solar radiation, consistently producing daily periods when operative temperatures exceeded 11.7 degrees C. However, high-latitude birds faced entire, consecutive days when parents would be unable to sustain required provisioning rates.

The uropygial gland produces an odoriferous secretion (preen oil) that can differ seasonally and between the sexes. These differences are hypothesized to function in olfactory camouflage, i.e. minimizing detection by nest predators (olfactory crypsis hypothesis), and/or intraspecific olfactory communication, particularly during breeding (sex semiochemical hypothesis). However, evidence for seasonal and sex differences in preen oil is mixed, with some studies finding differences and others not, and direct evidence for the putative function(s) of seasonal variation and sex differences in preen oil remains limited. We conducted a systematic review of the evidence for such changes in preen oil chemical composition, finding seasonal differences in 95% of species (57/60 species in 35 studies) and sex differences in 47% of species (28/59 species in 46 studies). We then conducted phylogenetic comparative analyses using data from 59 bird species to evaluate evidence for both the olfactory crypsis and sex semiochemical hypotheses. Seasonal differences were more likely in the incubating than non-incubating sex in ground-nesting species, but were equally likely regardless of incubation strategy in non-ground-nesting species. This result supports the olfactory crypsis hypothesis, if ground nesters are more vulnerable to olfactorily searching predators than non-ground nesters. Sex differences were more likely in species with uniparental than biparental incubation and during breeding than non-breeding, consistent with both the olfactory crypsis and sex semiochemical hypotheses. At present, the data do not allow us to disentangle these two hypotheses, but we provide recommendations that will enable researchers to do so.",2022,97,1193,1209,,10.1111/brv.12837,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/brv.12837,0,,,,

Herbicide followed by seeding of native plants reduces tall fescue and is predicted to restore habitat quality over time, but little is known about short-term (1-2 year) impacts on native species. We conducted a landscape-scale controlled experiment to assess the short-term effects of herbicide and seeding on the reproduction of an obligate grassland bird, the dickcissel (Spiza americana). In 2014, four sites in southern Iowa were each subdivided into three patches (mean 7 ha). One patch in each site was treated with glyphosate herbicide (spray-only), one with herbicide and native seeding (spray-and-seed), with the third serving as a control. Two sites were grazed by cattle from April to July and two sites were ungrazed. We monitored dickcissel reproduction in 2016, finding that they were more abundant, built more nests, experienced less cowbird parasitism, had increased nest survival, and produced more fledglings on spray-only and spray-and-seed treatments compared to control patches. Dickcissels nested infrequently on grazed sites-especially grazed control patches. We did not detect any impacts on clutch size, provisioning rates, or nestling mass, but Araneae (spiders) and Lepidoptera larvae (caterpillars) may have been smaller on sprayed patches. Positive responses by dickcissels were likely due to successful reduction of tall fescue and improved access to suitable nest sites through increased vegetation heterogeneity.

Oring, Fleischer, Reed, and Marsden (1992, Nature, 359 (6396), 631-633) proposed a mechanism to explain the occurrence of extrapair paternity in sequentially polyandrous species: sperm stored by females from within-pair copulations with a previous mate could fertilize eggs in the clutch of a subsequent male. Despite being proposed decades ago, evidence for this hypothesis remains limited. We studied social polyandry, extrapair paternity and copulation behaviour in a population of the red phalarope, Phalaropus fulicarius, a nonterritorial, sex role-reversed shorebird, with male-only care, in Utqia_gvik, Alaska. We tested multiple predictions from the 'sperm storage' hypothesis. Extrapair paternity occurred in 11% (37/334) of the nests and 4% (42/1182) of the eggs were sired by a male other than the incubating parent. Although a female's initial mate occasionally sired offspring in her next clutch, our results suggest that sperm stored from a previous mate does not play a major role in explaining the occurrence of extrapair paternity in this sequentially polyandrous species. Instead, extrapair paternity was generally due to extrapair copulations by both sexes during the period between pair establishment and early incubation and to rapid mate switching by females in the context of attempts to acquire multiple care-giving males.

Oviparous, non-avian reptiles have served as models to understand how environmental factors, like moisture availability, influence development because eggs are often exposed to prevailing environments in the absence of parental care. Though much research demonstrates the importance of water absorption by eggs, many ecological factors that influence moisture availability in natural nests have received little attention. For example, the type of substrate in which nests are constructed is understudied. We experimentally incubated eggs of the brown anole lizard (Anolis sagrei) in 2 naturally occurring nest substrates that were treated with varying amounts of water to determine how natural substrates influence development at different moisture concentrations. One substrate consisted of sand and crushed seashells and the other was mostly organic material (i.e. decayed plant material). Both are common nesting substrates at our field site. When controlling for water uptake by eggs, we found that egg survival and hatchling phenotypes were similar between substrates; however, embryos developed more quickly in the sand/shell substrate than the organic substrate, indicating substrate-specific effects on embryo physiology. These results demonstrate that different natural substrates can result in similar developmental outcomes if the water available to eggs is comparable; however, some aspects of development, like developmental rate, are affected by the type of substrate, independent of water availability. Further study is required to determine how natural substrates influence embryo physiology independent of water content.",2022,17,550,566,,10.1111/1749-4877.12553,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1749-4877.12553,0,,,,

Domed nests could be a costly specialisation, and we show that these nests take more time to be built, which could restrict breeding opportunities.

Therefore, in this study we examined the mechanism of role division in the Ryukyu Scops Owls Otus elegans on Minami-daito Island. Pairs of this species typically remain together and use the same nest over several years, so there is a possibility that their role division improves with experience over time. To clarify this, we studied the feeding frequency and territorial usage of individuals. Males fed their chicks more frequently than females, and experienced individuals using the same nests fed their chicks more than inexperienced individuals. On comparing experienced and inexperienced pairs, we found that experienced individuals hunted closer to the nest than inexperienced individuals. Furthermore, the home ranges of the males and females of experienced pairs, overlapped less than those of inexperienced pairs. Experience of using a nest site in consecutive years may allow such individual behavioural differences to develop and be involved in role division in parental care.",2022,21,3-2,44,,,,1,1,1,,1
2022-97,"Lin, YM; Patterson, A; Jimenez, AG; Elliott, K",Altered Oxidative Status as a Cost of Reproduction in a Seabird with High Reproductive Costs,PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY,"Life history theory posits that reproduction is constrained by a cost of reproduction such that any increase in breeding effort should reduce subsequent survival. Oxidative stress refers to an imbalance between the prooxidant reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant defense. If not thwarted, ROS can cause damage to DNA, lipids, and proteins, potentially increasing the rate of senescence and decreasing cellular function. Reproduction is often associated with higher metabolic rates, which could increase production of ROS and lead to oxidative damage if the animal does not increase antioxidant protection. Thus, oxidative stress could be one mechanism creating a cost of reproduction. In this study we explored how reproduction may affect oxidative status differently between male and female thick-billed murres during early and late breeding seasons over three consecutive years. We manipulated breeding efforts by removing an egg from the nest of some individuals, which forced females to relay, and by handicapping other individuals by clipping wings. We measured total antioxidant capacity (TAC), uric acid (UA) concentration, and malondialdehyde (MDA; an index of lipid oxidative damage) concentration in blood plasma as well as activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase (CAT) in red blood cells. Oxidative status was highly variable across years, and year was consistently the most important factor determining oxidative status; inconsistent results in previous field studies may be because reproductive oxidative stress occurs only in some years. Females had lower SOD and GPx and higher MDA and TAC than males immediately after egg laying, suggesting that the cost of egg laying required investment in cheaper nonenzymatic antioxidant defenses that had lower capacity for defending against lipid peroxidation. Delayed birds had lower UA and lower SOD, GPx, and CAT activity compared with control birds. In conclusion, when reproductive costs increase via higher energy costs or longer breeding seasons, the oxidative status of both male and female murres deteriorated as a result of reduced antioxidant defenses.",2022,95,35,53,,10.1086/717916,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/717916,0,,,,

We examined GPS tracking data among chick-provisioning albatrosses in Hawai'i to characterize habitats during short- and long-distance trips. The study period encompassed a marine heatwave (2014) and the cooling period after an extreme El Nino event (2016), enabling us to examine foraging habitats under novel and changing climates.

In this study, we conducted a questionnaire survey of UK householders to identify factors associated with the use of ground-level nest boxes for West European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus), a species of conservation concern. Overall, the percentage of boxes used at least once varied with season and type of use: summer day nesting (35.5-81.3%), breeding (7.2- 28.2%), winter day nesting (20.1-66.5%) and hibernation (21.7-58.6%). The length of time the box had been deployed, the availability of artificial food and front garden to back garden access significantly increased the likelihood that a nest box had been used for all four nesting types, whereas other factors related to placement within the garden (e.g., in a sheltered location, on hardstanding such as paving, distance from the house) and resource provisioning (bedding) affected only some nesting behaviours. The factors most strongly associated with nest box use were the provisioning of food and bedding. These data suggest, therefore, that householders can adopt simple practices to increase the likelihood of their nest box being used. However, one significant limitation evident within these data is that, for welfare reasons, householders do not routinely monitor whether their box has been used. Consequently, future studies need to adopt strategies which enable householders to monitor their boxes continuously. Ultimately, such studies should compare the survival rates and reproductive success of hedgehogs within artificial refuges versus more natural nest sites, and whether these are affected by, for example, the impact of nest box design and placement on predation risk and internal microclimate.",2022,10,,,e13662,10.7717/peerj.13662,http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.13662,0,,,,

However, although replacement clutches may increase an individual's annual reproductive success, they impose substantial energetic and fitness costs. In some cooperatively breeding species, helpers lighten breeders' workloads thereby facilitating a second clutch within a season or increasing their survival prospects. Alternatively, renesting may increase the chances of having help in replacement clutches as some individuals that have lost their own clutch could redirect their parental effort to another nest. Here we used a 20-year dataset of a facultative cooperative breeder, the Iberian magpie, Cyanopica cooki, to investigate how helping and renesting behaviours combine to affect reproductive output. After controlling for clutch size and laying date, we show that helpers had a positive effect on the reproductive success of pairs, particularly in replacement clutches. Indeed, our study revealed that replacement clutches were much more common than previously thought (observed in three-quarters of the females that lost the first clutch), and that the probability of receiving help was higher in replacement clutches. As helpers increased in number over the breeding season, they could contribute to buffering the negative effects of breeding late, when environmental conditions can be more adverse, and the probability of successful independent reproduction is lower. This study indicates that species with cooperative breeding and a short lifespan can prioritize current over future reproduction by renesting at the end of the breeding season, when the benefits of having help outweigh the costs associated with deteriorating environmental conditions. We propose that renesting can be a context-dependent strategy (mediated by social and environmental factors) that may increase reproductive success in avian cooperative breeding systems.

Studies assessing early HPA axis activation often rely on collection of blood samples to evaluate circulating glucocorticoid levels. However, blood sampling in small altricial young is invasive, limited by animal size, and not sufficient to provide detailed information about hormone exposure over protracted periods of time. We tested the use of feather corticosterone as an alternative method to assess HPA axis activity early in life in free-living, altricial chicks, for whom timing of growth of first feathers coincides with a period of rapid growth, development of the HPA axis, and reliance on parental care. We investigated (1) whether ecologically relevant bouts of experimental cooling prior to the onset of homeothermy-conditions known to elevate circulating corticosterone-are reflected in changes of feather corticosterone deposition in Eastern bluebird (Sialia sialis) chicks, and (2) whether such changes occurred in a sex-dependent manner. We found that cooling during the first week of life resulted in elevated feather corticosterone in first-grown feathers of experimentally cooled chicks relative to controls. The timing of deposition of corticosterone in feathers in response to temperature treatments was delayed in females compared to males. Results indicate that the hormone deposition in feather tissues of altricial nestlings reflects exposure to environmental stimuli, and can thus provide a minimally invasive tool for assessing HPA activity in early life.

If true, this has major ramifications for variation in the rates of energy acquisition within animal populations, which is particularly pertinent in offspring provisioning and breeding success, because smaller animals (the young) cannot starve for as long as the adults. However, despite much general speculation about rates of food acquisition, no study has measured whether food encounter is probabilistic in wild animals. We used animal-mounted cameras to document all prey captures by wild imperial shags Leucocarbo atriceps as they hunted underwater and show that, although they mostly do not have inter-prey acquisition time distributions that accord with a 'luck-based' framework assuming a constant probability of finding prey over time, there is no difference in the predicted amount of food captured between models that use the empirical data or theoretical Poisson-based fits of the data. We also noted considerable inter-individual differences in foraging success that far exceeded any differences between empirical and theoretical inter-prey acquisition time distributions. The data were used in a probabilistic for aging model that made explicit the mechanistic link between random prey encounters and food-dependent breeding success, indicating that 'less lucky' individuals could not provision their broods at rates commensurate with normal growth while the 'lucky' birds could do so easily. Given the nature of food encounter in these birds, coupled with substantial inter-individual variation in foraging success, we suggest that more successful individuals are particularly choosey about when, how Imperial shag are extraordinary birds that catch prey at depths of tens of metres underwater.

Moonlight, however, may affect prey capture as a side effect of its influence on prey behavior. Here we combine data of parental provisioning and quality of owlets with one ex-situ study of grasshopper activity to test whether Eurasian scops owls (Otus scops) with different plumage color and their prey are differently affected by moonlight. Food provisioning increased from new- to full-moon. However, the effect of moonlight on owlet mass gain and immune response depended on paternal coloration. On the one hand, body mass gain of nestlings of the greyest fathers increased from nights with new- to full-moon, whereas it did not change with moonlight for the brownest fathers. On the other hand, PHA response of nestlings of the brownest fathers increased with high moonlight levels during the first week of life, whereas it did not change with moonlight levels for the greyest fathers. Grasshoppers were more active at new moon than at full or waning moon. Our study provides supporting evidence that moonlight influences the behavior of both scops owls and its prey and suggests that fluctuations in environmental conditions can modulate the advantages of morphs. These results are important because they provide a general insight into a little appreciated mechanism for the maintenance of color polymorphism in natural populations based on the interactive effect of different environmental factors. Moonlight favors different strategies of nestling care in brown and grey owls.

They are exceptionally well adapted to forage over enormous areas to maximize chances of encountering prey. Their wide-ranging travel, extensive use of oceanic habitats beyond national jurisdictions (the high seas), and limited information on their at-sea distributions and foraging ecology pose several management challenges. Here, we examined the foraging distributions and habitat preferences of three gadfly petrels that breed on Phillip Island (Norfolk Island Group), in the southwest Pacific Ocean, and tested the ability of species distribution models (SDMs) to predict important marine habitats. GPS loggers were deployed in 2018 and 2019 on chick-provisioning black-winged petrels (P. nigripennis) and white-necked petrels (P. cervicalis) and in 2020 on Kermadec petrels (P. neglecta), and hidden Markov models (HMMs) were used to estimate behavioral states across 387 foraging trips. SDMs were built using six algorithms and the predictive performance of models constructed using conventional random cross-validation (CV) was compared to those constructed with spatially independent CV. All three species demonstrated dual-foraging strategies with short trips closer to the colony and longer, presumably self-provisioning, trips with maximum distances from the colony of several thousand kilometers for black-winged and white-necked petrels. Foraging areas of each species were distinctly partitioned across the Tasman Sea during long trips, but there was high overlap during short trips. Black-winged and white-necked petrels exhibited area-restricted search foraging behavior throughout their foraging ranges which spanned almost the entire Tasman Sea and into the western Pacific, whereas the foraging range of Kermadec petrels was restricted closer to the colony. Approximately half of each species' foraging range extended into the high seas. Response curves and variable importance between the two SDM CV approaches were similar, suggesting that model fitting was robust to the CV approach. However, evaluation using spatially independent CV indicated that generalizability of ensemble SDMs to new data ranged from poor to fair for all three species. This suggests that the maximal-area foraging strategy of gadfly petrels (whereby they search opportunistically for resources across expansive oceanic habitats) results in weak or wide associations with environmental features making predicting important habitats extremely challenging.",2022,9,,,853104,10.3389/fmars.2022.853104,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2022.853104,0,,,,

We used tracking data of 31 SGPs (adults and juveniles) from Patagonian colonies. Lagrangian simulations of particles were released from coastal cities and fisheries. Oceanographic features together with plastic input generated a corridor of debris through the Argentine shelf with areas of high debris accumulation, exposing SGP to plastic consumption. During chick provisioning trips 93.9% of petrel's locations overlapped with areas of plastic accumulation. Although early developmental stages were more exposed to particles from cities, the exposure of petrels (all classes) to debris from fisheries was 10% higher than from cities.

This phenomenon may be particularly frequent in colonial species, when individuals breed in large aggre-gations and are constrained to exploit shared foraging areas surrounding the colony site where competition for access to food resources may be high. Foraging specialization may be driven by indi-vidual foraging site fidelity, occurring whenever individuals consistently target specific foraging sites, which may differ from those used by other colony members. We assessed the extent of foraging specialization in a colonial breeding raptor, the lesser kestrel, Falco naumanni, by estimating the repeatability of foraging movement patterns of 45 GPS-tracked individuals during both incubation and nestling rearing. We found that the consistency of individual movement patterns was generally higher during nestling rearing than during incubation. Nestling-rearing individuals, but not incubating ones, travelled along relatively consistent routes when targeting foraging grounds and tended to target the same foraging areas throughout the tracking period. In colonial birds, and likely in altricial species more generally, an increased individual foraging site fidelity during nestling rearing versus incubation may result from increased energy demands due to frequent nestling provisioning in addition to self -provisioning. By consistently exploiting previously visited foraging sites that are likely to be rewarding, nestling-rearing birds might indeed increase their foraging efficiency, shortening food -searching time and maximizing their foraging effort. In addition, the use of distinct foraging areas may reduce intraspecific competition for food, thus buffering an important cost of coloniality.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

For example, risky behaviour such as mobbing a predator would be selected if participants are genetic relatives because they share a frac-tion of their gene pool (i.e., kin selection or indirect benefits). However, in the absence of genetic relatedness, benefits can be achieved by direct benefits such as reciprocity or mutualism, among others. In this study we analyzed the cooperative mobbing behaviour in winter flocks of an endemic passerine of the austral temperate forests, the Thorn-tailed rayadito (Aphrastura spinicauda). We first tested whether the probability of and the latency to mobbing response differed depending on the acoustic stimulus perceived by the flock (i.e., conspecific mobbing calls vs. predator calls), and whether the intensity of the mobbing was related to the number of individuals and species partic-ipating. We found that flocks were more likely to approach the predator when the acoustic signal was a conspecific mobbing call than when it was the predator's call, and that the intensity of mob-bing increased with the number of participants. Secondly, we explored if the level of kinship within the group potentially played a role in the development of the mobbing behaviour. The proportion of close-relatives found in these flocks was low, and the within-and among-flock degree of kinship did not differ. This suggests that kin selection might not be related with the expression of mobbing behaviour in winter flocks.",2022,159,759,780,,10.1163/1568539X-bja10149,http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1568539X-bja10149,0,,,,

This is particularly important for dimorphic species with polygynous mating where males face strong selection pressures to attain large size and access to reproductive females. We tracked 17 male Antarctic fur seals, Arctocephalus gazella, during their prolonged postbreeding trips and assessed links between their movements and environmental predictors of profitable feeding areas. Males made one of two types of trips: a long trip to the Antarctic ice edge or shorter trips to areas where the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current fronts generate high biological activity. The trip type was not determined by body size but was related to departure date from the breeding area, suggesting that males must trade off opportunities at the breeding area (reproductive, social interactions) and foraging opportunities between breeding seasons. Regardless of trip structure, males focused search effort far from foraging areas of central-place foraging seabirds and seals including female Antarctic fur seals provisioning offspring. Males showed clear spatiotemporal patterns in dive behaviour, with deep dives in shelf waters during the day and predominantly shallower dives in pelagic waters at night. Diel dive patterns showed monthly changes in photoperiod and lunar phase, consistent with feeding on vertically migrating prey. However, males did not use area-restricted search to focus dive effort, instead performing a mix of foraging and nonforaging behaviour within and between restricted search areas. We discuss the scale and type of inference that can be made from movement models, given the behavioural constraints that govern long-distance trips in vast, heterogeneous environments like the Southern Ocean.(c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

However, little is known about the covariations of body mass with the nutritional state of animals as measured through plasma metabolites and how these different measures vary between and within individuals during breeding. Here, we assessed intra-individual variations of plasma metabolites (triglycerides, cholesterol, protein, and ss-hydroxybutyrate concentrations) and in body mass of Blue-footed boobies (Sula nebouxii) throughout their breeding season 2011-2012 in Isla El Rancho, Mexico. We found breeding-stage and sex-specific variations in individuals' plasma metabolite concentrations, but these did not mirror variations in body mass. Before egg-laying, females had higher triglycerides, cholesterol, and protein concentrations than males. In contrast, males used their nutritional reserves (higher ss-hydroxybutyrate concentrations) more than females during the breeding season (except for early chick-rearing). At the individual level, males gained weight during the breeding season, whereas females lost weight. We also found that between-individual differences in plasma metabolite concentrations and changes in body mass were not consistent throughout the breeding season, while individual body mass was significantly repeatable. This study contributes to a better understanding of seabird breeding ecology and physiology by showing that sex-specific breeding roles might highly influence the nutritional state.

Intersexual selection through female mate choice might be an important driver of the evolution of cognitive traits, especially in monogamous species, where females may obtain direct fitness benefits by choosing mates with better cognitive abilities. However, the importance given by female to male cognitive traits might vary among species and/or populations according to their life-history traits and ecology. To disentangle the effects of natural and sexual selection, here we use an agent-based simulation model and compare the model's predictions when females mate with the first randomly encountered male (i.e., under natural selection) versus when they choose among males based on their cognitive trait values (i.e., under natural and intersexual selection). Males and females are characterized, respectively, by their problem-solving ability and assessment strategy. At each generation, agents go through (1) a choosing phase during which females assess the cognitive abilities of potential mates until eventually finding an acceptable one and (2) a reproductive phase during which all males compete for limited resources that are exploited at a rate, which depends on their cognitive abilities. Because males provide paternal care, the foraging success of mated males determines the breeding success of the pair through its effect on nestling provisioning efficiency. The model predicts that intersexual selection plays a major role in most ecological conditions, by either reinforcing or acting against the effect of natural selection. The latter case occurs under harsh environmental conditions, where intersexual selection contributes to maintaining cognitive diversity. Our findings thus demonstrate the importance of considering the interaction between both selective forces and highlight the need to build a conceptual framework to target relevant cognitive traits.",2022,12,,,e9066,10.1002/ece3.9066,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.9066,0,,,,

For some species, group living may be facultative, and individuals may live solitarily or aggregate with conspecifics or heterospecifics, but the advantages of each strategy are still poorly known. Here, we investigated whether a predominantly solitary breeding species, the European roller, Coracias garrulus, acquires antipredator benefits from nesting in mixed-species colonies dominated by lesser kestrels, Falco naumanni. We compared the risk-taking behaviour of solitary rollers and rollers breeding in colonies by conducting two experiments. First, we investigated rollers??? latency to resume incubation when presented with a novel object, and second assessed their latency to resume chick provisioning and their investment in mobbing behaviour towards a predator model. We additionally compared the breeding performance and nest predation rate of rollers in each social context (solitary versus colonial) using data from 300 breeding attempts across 6 years. We found that rollers breeding in colonies returned to their nests sooner during the presentation of both the novel object and the predator model and attacked the predator model less frequently than solitary rollers, suggesting they can use heterospecifics as cues in deciding whether it is safe to return to their nests. In addition, rollers in colonies suffered less nest predation than solitary ones, but this did not translate into a higher productivity. Future studies should investigate whether breeding in colonies provides other advantages to rollers, such as increased adult survival or fitness. ?? 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis) and Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) breed and forage in the same habitat on Kent Island, a boreal island in the Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick, but respond differently to the same weather conditions. The 2 passerines are similar in body size but because Tree Swallows depend upon small flying insects captured on the wing, they may be more sensitive to weather than Savannah Sparrows, which forage on insects and seeds on the ground and in shrubs and trees. To compare how reproductive success in the 2 species was affected by weather conditions, we took advantage of an 18-year dataset and used a model-building approach that controlled for year, adult sex and age, and field where they nested. We focused on 3 measures of reproductive success (hatching success, fledging success, and nestling condition) and different time periods (3- to 18-day time windows) before hatching or fledging. The responses of the 2 species differed in magnitude and direction. In Tree Swallows, adding weather variables to the basic model increased the explanatory power of fixed effects by 19.1%, illustrating the swallows' sensitivity to weather.

Despite females undertaking significantly more dives than males, this low energetic cost resulted in no sex differences in overall energy expenditure across a foraging trip. Bayesian stable isotope mixing models based on blood samples highlighted sex differences in diet; however, calorific intake from successful prey capture was estimated to be similar between sexes.

Previous comparative studies have found that egg rejection rates covary with several biotic factors (including larger body size, smaller relative brain size, and more northerly breeding latitudes), but much behavioral variation in the occurrence of egg rejection remains unexplained. In this study, we test a corollary of the maternal investment hypothesis, by assessing whether species with higher clutch sizes are more likely to eliminate parasitic eggs. We examined two published data sets comprising over 200 unique bird species, controlling for phylogeny and other known interspecific correlates of egg rejection rates. Contrary to the prediction, we found no evidence for a positive relationship between clutch size and egg rejection rate. Rather, our analyses suggest a weak but consistent negative relationship between absolute and relative metrics of clutch size versus egg rejection rate across species. These results are instead consistent with two previously proposed alternative hypotheses: that egg rejection is constrained by a trade-off between maternal investment and anti-parasitic defenses, possibly mediated by endocrine mechanisms linked to parental care, and/or that cognitive decision rules facilitate the detection of dissimilar eggs in smaller clutches.",2022,36,263,272,,10.1007/s10682-022-10165-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10682-022-10165-w,0,,,,

For example, while engaging in predator deterrence, reactive individuals tend to prioritise their own survival, while proactive individuals engage in riskier behaviours. Studies linking animal personality measured in captivity with individual fitness or behaviours in the wild are sparse, which is a gap in knowledge this study aims to address. We used playback experiments in superb fairy-wrens (Malurus cyaneus), a common Australian songbird with a cooperative breeding system, to assess whether three personality traits measured during short-term captivity correlated with behavioural responses in the wild to a perceived nest and adult predator, the grey currawong (Strepera versicolor). We used three standard measures of personality in birds: struggle responses to human handling (boldness), exploration during a novel environment test, and aggressiveness during a mirror presentation. Superb fairy-wrens showed a significantly stronger response to the predator playback than to the control (willie wagtail, Rhipidura leucophrys) playback, suggesting that they recognised the predator playback as a threat without any accompanying visual stimulus. Birds that attacked their mirror image during the mirror presentation and those that spent a moderate amount of time close to the mirror responded more strongly to predator playback (by approaching the speaker faster and closer, spending more time near the speaker, and being more likely to alarm call) compared to those with low aggressiveness or those that spent very short or long durations close to the mirror. Neither boldness nor exploration in the novel environment test predicted playback response.

In response to this heterogeneous context, marine predators such as seabirds need to maximize their foraging efficiency, especially during the breeding season, when movement is restricted by the need to return to the nest. Biologging technologies such as satellite transmitters and Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers allow researchers to track birds at sea and investigate the relationship between foraging strategy and changing oceanographic features. Our study focuses on characterizing the feeding areas of Magnificent Frigatebird (Fregata magnificens) breeding in Baja California Sur, Mexico. We used GPS receivers to track the foraging flights of frigatebirds during 2017-2019, identifying the core foraging areas and characterizing environmental conditions and marine productivity in these areas. Individuals repeatedly selected areas close to the colonies located in Espiritu Santo archipelago (Gulf of California) and Santa Margarita Island (Pacific Ocean). However, some males flew to more distant and equally productive areas to the south and north of the Baja California peninsula. We presume that the differential use of foraging areas between males and females reflects biometrical and behavioral differences of the sexes, which may explain the relationships between foraging behavior and breeding, intraspecific competition, and sex-based differences in parental investment. Because frigatebirds are considered indicators of marine environmental conditions, our data are useful to identify areas where prey species aggregate in space and time and, therefore, to expand the boundaries of existing marine protected areas. Data on seabird foraging ranges described here can be useful for delineating marine protected area boundaries and can be considered suitable candidates for inclusion in appropriately designated regional marine spatial planning.",2022,17,,,25,10.5751/ACE-02202-170225,http://dx.doi.org/10.5751/ACE-02202-170225,0,,,,

Their high pest control potential in apple orchards has been documented. Nestbox provisioning is an increasingly suggested tool for ecological pest control, but the underlying assumption that birds forage in intensively managed orchards has never been formally tested. We conducted a fine-scale study of the great tit feeding microhabitat in different orchard management contexts as pesticide use affects the behaviour and physiology of birds through direct intoxication and reduced prey abundance. Using radiotracking techniques, we assessed foraging areas and foraging habitat selection of female great tits breeding in conventional and organic commercial apple orchards. We also tested whether different orchard-driven foraging strategies could be linked to differences in reproductive success. We collected 392 foraging locations from seven female great tits nesting in organic orchards and 375 locations from seven females nesting in conventional orchards. Females from organic orchards mostly searched for food inside the orchard where they bred. This contrasted strongly with females from conventional orchards (54 +/- 10.4 % and 7.1 +/- 3.0 % of foraging points inside the orchard, respectively). Further, females from organic orchards travelled shorter distances. Overall, organic orchards and hedgerows were the most preferred foraging habitats. Conventional orchard management was also associated with lower nestling survival and lower fledgling number than organic management. There were indications that the mean number of fledglings decreased with increasing mean foraging distance of the female. Our novel insights on the foraging behaviour of great tits in orchards support the benefits of installing nestboxes in organic but not in conventional orchards.

I examined the causes and consequences for divorce in the Northern Flicker (Colaptes auratus), a migratory woodpecker with a high annual mortality rate. In a long-term population study of 1,793 breeding pairs over 17 years, the within-season divorce rate was 4.6% and the between-season divorce rate was 15.5%. Retained pairs within a season initiated their renest 5 days faster than divorced birds that had no greater fledgling production, suggesting that within-season divorce was making the best of a bad job with severe time constraints. Poor performance in the year prior to divorce was not strongly associated with divorce, and analysis of multiple breeding stages revealed that divorcing individuals in the subsequent year had later laying dates, smaller clutches, and fewer fledglings than retained pairs but no better performance than widowed individuals. Analyzing the data separately by sex showed that neither males nor females benefitted from divorce. Thus, there is a reproductive cost linked to finding a new partner per se, but no reproductive advantage associated with divorce. New mates after divorce were usually not older (not higher quality) than previous mates, so intrasexual competition was probably not driving partnership splits. The most plausible explanation seems to be a bet-hedging hypothesis in which birds re-pair rapidly in spring if their previous mate does not quickly arrive during spring migration. Divorce in Northern Flickers does not appear to be adaptive and future studies on arrival and interactions of individuals in spring will elucidate proximate constraints on relocating the previous partner.",2022,139,,,,10.1093/ornithology/ukab058,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ornithology/ukab058,0,,,,

We sampled adults, chicks, and juvenile individuals' whole blood from three colonies of Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) from Tierra del Fuego along an inshore-offshore corridor. We analyzed the isotopic niche, the trophic position and the diet composition in penguins to investigate intraspecific trophic niche variation in relation to biological (age of individuals) and external factors (foraging habitats, colony location) using carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope values. We found isotopic niche segregation between age classes within each colony. When comparing across colonies, only juvenile exhibited some degree of isotopic niche overlap among colonies. In addition, at all three colonies juveniles had the largest isotopic niches with relatively higher variation in delta C-13 values. All individuals consumed low trophic position (TP) prey items such as the pelagic form of Munida gregaria based on stable isotope mixing model results. Adults and juveniles incorporated high TP (silverside and nototheniids) prey items into their diets, except for juveniles from Martillo Island whose proportions mirror chicks' values. These results denote that parents consumed different prey items for themselves than for their chicks.

This study aimed to verify these patterns in a long-distance migrant, the Eurasian curlew Numenius arquata arquata, and to provide a synopsis of spatio-temporal migration patterns in this species of concern throughout the East Atlantic Flyway. We tagged 85 adults with GPS-data loggers in Germany, Poland, France and Estonia between 2013 and 2019. We computed the distance flown, linear loxodromic distance, duration, stopover number, total stopover duration, mean stopover duration, departure time and arrival time for 177 out of 187 tracks.

Curlews displayed chain migration because wintering curlews maintained the latitudinal sequence to their breeding sites. Southern curlews had a longer nesting period due to their earlier arrivals. While spring arrival at breeding sites did not differ between the sexes, in autumn females departed earlier than males. Migration duration and distance, as well as stopover number and duration, showed a significant increase with breeding site latitude but did not differ between the sexes or between spring and autumn migrations, suggesting that curlews took a comparable amount of time migrating during both seasons. The high site faithfulness in curlews suggests that rapid autumn migration allows them to return to defend their winter foraging areas.",2022,2022,,,e02924,10.1111/jav.02924,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jav.02924,0,,,,

Coordination is difficult if opportunities to communicate are scarce, which might have led to the evolution of elaborate nest relief rituals in species facing a low predation risk. However, whether such conspicuous rituals also evolved in species that avoid predation by relying on crypsis remains unclear. Here, we used a continuous monitoring system to describe nest relief behaviour during incubation in an Arctic-breeding shorebird with passive nest defence, the Semipalmated Sandpiper Calidris pusilla. We also explored whether behaviour of exchanging parents informs about parental coordination and predicts incubation effort. We found that incubating parents vocalized twice as much before the arrival of their partner than during other times of incubation. In at least 75% of exchanges, the incubating parent left the nest only after its partner had returned and initiated the nest relief. In these cases, exchanges were quick (25 s, median) and shortened over the incubation period by 0.1-1.4 s/day (95% CI), suggesting that parents became more synchronized. However, nest reliefs were not cryptic. In 90% of exchanges, at least one parent vocalized, and in 20% of nest reliefs the incubating parent left the nest only after its returning partner called incessantly. In 27% of cases, the returning parent initiated the nest relief with a call; in 39% of these cases, the incubating partner replied. If the partner replied, its following off-nest bout was 1-4 h (95% CI) longer than when the partner did not reply, which corresponds to an 8-45% increase. Our results indicate that incubating Semipalmated Sandpipers, which rely on crypsis to avoid nest predation, have quick but acoustically conspicuous nest reliefs.

Tracking data from seabirds are widely used to define priority areas for conservation, but such data are often restricted to the breeding population. This also applies to penguins in Antarctica, where identification of important habitat for nonbreeders has received limited attention. Nonbreeding penguins are expected to have larger foraging distributions than breeding conspecifics, which may alter their interactions with physical environmental factors, conspecifics, other marine predators, and threats. We studied the movement behavior of nonbreeding Adelie penguins tracked during the 2016/2017 breeding season at King George Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. We quantify how nonbreeding penguins' horizontal moment behavior varies in relation to environmental conditions and assess the extent of spatial overlap in the foraging ranges of nonbreeders and breeders, which were tracked over several years. Nonbreeders increased their prey search and area-restricted foraging behavior as sea surface temperature and bottom depths decreased, and in response to increasing sea ice concentration. Nonbreeders tended to transit (high directional movement) over the relatively deep Central Basin of the Bransfield Strait. The majority of foraging behavior occurred within the colder, Weddell Sea-sourced water of the Antarctic Coastal Current (incubation) and in the Weddell Sea (creche). The utilization distributions of breeders and nonbreeders overlapped in the central Bransfield Strait. Spatial segregation was greater during the creche stage of breeding compared to incubation and brood, because chick provisioning still constrained the foraging range of breeders to a scale of a few tens of kilometers, while nonbreeders commenced with premolt foraging trips into the Weddell Sea. Our results show that breeding and nonbreeding penguins may not be impacted similarly by local environmental variability, given that their spatial and temporal scales of foraging differ during some part of the austral summer. Our study highlights the need to account for different life history stages when characterizing foraging behavior of marine predator populations.

Among nestling birds, time spent in the nest, risk of predation, and lifespan covary, but some associations are only found within species while others are only observed between species. A recent comparative study suggests that allocation trade-offs may be alleviated by disinvestment in ephemeral traits, such as nest-grown feathers, that are quickly replaced. However, direct resource allocation trade-offs cannot be inferred from interspecific trait associations without complementary intraspecific studies. Here, we asked whether there is evidence for a within-species allocation trade-off between feather quality and time spent in the nest in Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor). Consistent with the idea that ephemeral traits are deprioritized, nest-grown feathers had lower barb density than adult feathers. However, despite substantial variation in fledging age among nestlings, there was no evidence for a negative association between time in the nest and feather quality. Furthermore, accounting for differences in resource availability by considering provisioning rate and a nest predation treatment did not reveal a trade-off that was masked by variation in resources. Our results are most consistent with the idea that the interspecific association between development and feather quality arises from adaptive specialization, rather than from a direct allocation trade-off.

In forests of western North America, disturbance from fire can lead to resource pulses of deadwood-associated arthropods that provide important prey for woodpeckers. Although the foraging strategies among woodpecker species often demonstrate pronounced differences, little is known about the ways in which woodpeckers exploit and partition prey in disturbed areas. In this study, we employed DNA metabarcoding to characterize and compare the arthropod diets of 4 woodpecker species in Washington and California, USA-Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), Hairy Woodpecker (Dryobates villosus), Northern Flicker (Colaptes auratus), and White-headed Woodpecker (Dryobates albolarvatus)-primarily using nestling fecal samples from burned forests 1-13 years postfire. Successful sequencing from 78 samples revealed the presence of over 600 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) spanning 32 arthropod orders. The nestling diets of two species in particular-Northern Flicker and Black-backed Woodpecker-proved to be much broader than previous observational studies suggest. Northern Flicker nestlings demonstrated significantly higher diet diversity compared to other focal species, all of which displayed considerable overlap in diversity. Wood-boring beetles, which colonize dead and dying trees after fire, were particularly important diet items for Black-backed, Hairy, and White-headed woodpeckers. Diet composition differed among species, and diets showed limited differences between newer (<= 5 yr) and older (>5 yr) postfire forests. Our results show mixed evidence for dietary resource partitioning, with three of the four focal species exhibiting relatively high diet overlap, perhaps due to the pulsed subsidy of deadwood-associated arthropods in burned forests.

Therefore, including different noise types in the same study can best elucidate the effects of noise properties on bird behaviour and reproduction. In this study, we used two structurally different noise types to explore noise effects on the incubation behaviour of great tits (Parus major). Female great tits incubate, and males feed them. We filmed 25 pairs of great tits in the control phase (no additional noise) and the experimental phase for two hours using the continuous playback of a chainsaw or the lawnmower noise with the same amplitude. The chainsaw noise significantly decreased the number of female nest visits but did not affect nest attendance. The lawnmower noise, meanwhile, did not influence any aspect of incubation behaviour. As chainsaw noise is higher in frequency (0.5-8 kHz vs. 0.2-2 kHz for lawnmower), there is a greater degree of overlap with passerines' hearing range (1-8 kHz), and it probably hinders their ability to receive acoustic signals and cues. The chainsaw noise likely alters the incubating behaviour of passerines via increased vigilance (the incubating female does not hear partner's calls) or decreased foraging as well.

Urban Female Song Sparrows Elevate Aggressive Signaling Compared to Rural,INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY,"The costs and benefits of breeding behaviors are influenced by environmental conditions, and habitat variation can shift the degree to which behaviors are expressed. Novel urban habitats have been shown to differ significantly in disturbances such as noise, light at night, and human presence, as well as resource availability, compared to rural habitats. Perhaps because of these environmental differences, urban males of several species are consistently more aggressive than rural males, raising the hypothesis that greater territorial aggression is beneficial in urban habitats. Though often ignored, female songbirds of many species also perform aggressive territorial behaviors toward conspecifics during the breeding season. For socially monogamous songbirds, this aggression functions to ensure partner fidelity and secure resources for reproduction. Studies of the effects of urbanization on songbird behavior have yet to determine if urban females also express greater territorial aggression. Importantly, energetically demanding behaviors such as territoriality and parental care should constrain one another, leading to behavioral trade-offs during the breeding season. Though territorial aggression and parental care are inversely related in males of several species of songbird, this relationship is understudied in female songbirds, particularly those facing environmental change, such as urbanization. In this study, we compared aggressive signaling and a measure of parental care (maternal nest visitation rates) between female song sparrows (Melospiza melodia), living in urban and rural habitats. We hypothesized that female aggressive signaling would be higher in urban environments compared to rural, and negatively correlated with maternal visitation rates. We found that urban females, like males, expressed increased aggressive signaling compared to rural. However, female aggressive signaling was not related to our measure of maternal care, suggesting females aren't facing a trade-off between these two behaviors. Collectively, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that urban habitats promote territorial aggression in female song sparrows. As urbanization continues to spread, understanding the behavioral changes animals employ in urban environments requires studying individuals of different sexes and age classes, and will help us understand how some species are able to cope with human-induced rapid environmental change.",NA,NA,,,,10.1093/icb/icac106,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icb/icac106,1,1,1,,1

We found significant effects of maternal phenotype on fecundity, hatching success, and tadpole size, as well as on the duration of larval development. Interestingly, and more surprisingly, we also found a potential contribution of the paternal phenotype occurring during early (embryonic development duration) offspring development. Although our study focused on life-history traits such as body size and development duration, additional mechanisms involving physiological costs of development may well mediate the relationships between parental phenotypes and offspring development. Future studies are required to decipher the mechanisms underlying our findings in order to clarify the mechanistic basis of the links between parental phenotypes and offspring development.",NA,NA,,,,10.1093/cz/zoac072,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cz/zoac072,0,,,,

Most studies have focused on bird species with marked sexual dimorphism and multiple-nestling broods, where the offspring sex ratio is often biased due to different individual or environmental variables. However, biases in offspring sex ratios have been far less investigated in monomorphic and single-egg laying species, and few studies have evaluated long-term and large-scale variations in the sex ratio of nestling vultures. Here, we explore individual and environmental factors potentially affecting the secondary sex ratio of the monomorphic griffon vulture Gyps fulvus. We used information collected at three breeding nuclei from central Spain over a 30-year period (1990-2020) to analyse the effects of nestling age, parental age, breeding phenology, conspecific density, population reproductive parameters, and spatial and temporal variability on nestling sex. Sex ratio did not differ from parity either at the population or the nuclei level. No significant between-year differences were detected, even under highly changing conditions of food availability associated with the mad-cow crisis. We found that tree nesting breeders tend to have more sons than daughters, but as this nesting behavior is rare and we consequently have a small sample size, this issue would require additional examination. Whereas further research is needed to assess the potential effect of breeder identity on nestling sex ratio, this study contributes to understanding the basic ecology and population dynamics of Griffon Vultures, a long-lived species with deferred maturity and low fecundity, whose minor deviations in the offspring sex ratio might imply major changes at the population level.",NA,NA,,,,10.1093/cz/zoac046,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cz/zoac046,0,,,,

Variations in the EPP appear to link to behavioral and ecological factors and sexual selection. According to the relationship intelligence hypothesis, the cognitive abilities of the birds play an important role in maintaining long-term relationships. Here, we undertook the first comparative test of the relationships between extra-pair paternity and brain size, testis size, and life histories among 315 species of birds using phylogenetically controlled comparative analyses and path analysis. After controlling for the effects of shared ancestry and body mass, the frequency of EPP was negatively correlated with relative brain size, but positively with testis size across species of birds. However, the frequency of EPP was not linked to life-history traits (e.g. incubation period, fledging period, clutch size, egg mass, and longevity). Our findings suggest that large-brained birds associated with enhanced cognitive abilities are more inclined to maintain long-term stable relationships with their mates and to mutualism with them than to increase the frequency of EPP.",NA,NA,,,,10.1111/1749-4877.12636,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1749-4877.12636,0,,,,

The primary function of the nest is to protect offspring from the environment and predators. Field studies in a number of passerine species have indicated that higher-latitude populations in colder habitats build larger nests with thicker walls compared to lower-latitude populations, but that these larger nests are more vulnerable to predation. Increases in nest size can also be driven by sexual selection, as nest size can act as a signal of parental quality and prompt differential investment in other aspects of care. It is unknown, however, how these microevolutionary patterns translate to a macroevolutionary scale. Here, we investigate potential drivers of variation in the outer and inner volume of open cup nests using a large dataset of nest measurements from 1117 species of passerines breeding in a diverse range of environments. Our dataset is sourced primarily from the nest specimens at the Natural History Museum (UK), complemented with information from ornithological handbooks and online databases. We use phylogenetic comparative methods to test long-standing hypotheses about potential macroevolutionary correlates of nest size, namely nest location, clutch size and variables relating to parental care, together with environmental and geographical factors such as temperature, rainfall, latitude and insularity. After controlling for phylogeny and parental body size, we demonstrate that the outer volume of the nest is greater in colder climates, in island-dwelling species and in species that nest on cliffs or rocks. By contrast, the inner cup volume is associated solely with average clutch size, increasing with the number of chicks raised in the nest. We do not find evidence that nest size is related to the length of parental care for nestlings. Our study reveals that the average temperature in the breeding range, along with several key life-history traits and proxies of predation threat, shapes the global interspecific variation in passerine cup nest size. We also showcase the utility of museum nest collections-a historically underused resource-for large-scale studies of trait evolution.",NA,NA,,,,10.1111/1365-2656.13815,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13815,0,,,,

Previous studies have examined several hypotheses for this variation by looking at factors such as morphological characteristics of the parents and the characteristics of the brood, but few have controlled for multiple factors simultaneously. Here we examined a broad range of factors that may influence the nest defense behaviour of Mountain Bluebirds (Sialia currucoides (Bechstein, 1798)), including the adult's morphology (sex, age, plumage colour, body size, and body condition) and characteristics of their brood (size, hatch date, and stage of nestling development). Parental aggression was triggered using a taxidermy mount of an American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus (Erxleben, 1777)). We found no relationship between nest defense and any morphological characteristic of adults, but the intensity of nest defense was positively correlated with the stage of offspring development, clutch size, and hatch date consistent with parental investment theory. Males also defended nests more strongly than females, consistent with the premise of the renesting hypothesis that males have fewer future opportunities to breed and, therefore, are more invested in the current brood. Our results provide strong support for parental investment theory and renesting as the primary drivers of nest defense intensity in breeding birds.",NA,NA,,,,10.1139/cjz-2022-0064,http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2022-0064,0,,,,

Specifically, we tested whether indices of offspring performance (e.g. offspring mass near the time of their independence and/or growth rate) from three Antarctic krill-dependent predators, showed positive relationships with estimates of krill density, determined using fishery-independent acoustic surveys undertaken towards the middle of the predator breeding season. Results showed that indices of predator reproductive performance had little relationship with krill density. In most years, average krill densities were higher on-shelf than off-shelf, potentially providing ecological buffering for predators provisioning offspring. Interestingly, positive response relationships were evident between predator offspring mass and the spatial distribution of krill, measured using indices that represent levels of inequality (patchiness) in krill distribution. These relationships were strongest using indices that reflected the off-shelf krill spatial distribution. We found that krill density and predator offspring mass were also both negatively influenced by sea surface temperature and the Southern Annular Mode, indicating that the environment exerts strong control over ecosystem processes. Finally, we consider the relevance of our results to the ecological framework used by managers responsible for setting catch limits for the regional fishery for krill.",NA,NA,,,,10.1093/icesjms/fsac168,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsac168,0,,,,
2022-143,"Warkentin, IG; Brooks, DW; Lieske, DJ; Espie, RHM; James, PC",Brood sex ratios in Merlins reflect characteristics of the associated breeding male and population density,IBIS,"Population-level estimates of offspring sex ratios in birds typically approximate parity whereas biased ratios within nests are not uncommon. In sexually dimorphic raptors, the costs and relative fitness benefits of rearing male and female progeny vary with changing environmental circumstances. This may lead to substantial deviations from balanced investment in offspring of a particular sex by individual parents. Based on a 13-year dataset for breeding Merlins Falco columbarius in Saskatoon, Canada, we used a model selection approach to assess the influence of parents, nest-mates and nesting area on brood sex ratio during the nestling phase. The best model for predicting brood sex ratio included age of the breeding male and brood size for each nest (n = 127); nests with older male breeders and smaller brood sizes had more female young. The population-level annualized average proportion of male offspring was 0.472 +/- 0.017 (mean +/- standard error), but tended towards greater production of female young during an initial period of population growth (8 years, 10-21 pairs; proportion male 0.435 +/- 0.031) versus a period when the population fluctuated around a presumed carrying capacity (11 years, 24-33 pairs; proportion male 0.500 +/- 0.017). Energetics appears to be a finely tuned mechanism driving sex ratio allocation in Merlins at both brood and population levels. Provisioning food for young in the nest represents the male's ability to successfully capture prey, reflecting his age and/or experience, as well as the availability of prey to the male. Confounding this mechanism to determine sex ratio allocation are the pressures created by population dynamics that dictate competition for resources both within the nest (brood size) and external to the nest (population density).",NA,NA,,,,10.1111/ibi.13159,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.13159,1,1,0,no provisioning data,

In this study, we tested predictions from the kin selection, pay-to-stay, group augmentation and skills hypotheses, to explain why group members feed nestlings of breeding placid greenbuls (Phyllastrephus placidus). In our study population, about 70% of the breeding pairs were accompanied by subordinates, and in 60% of these cases at least one subordinate helped in provisioning nestlings. In total, 80% of the subordinates were related to one or both breeders. In accordance with the kin selection hypothesis, and contrary to the pay-to-stay hypothesis, all the helpers were first-order kin of the breeding female (although relatedness to the breeding male did not explain variation in helping) and the presence of helpers was associated with increased survival of the breeding pair. However, the propensity to help varied among group members, as 46% of group members related to the breeding female did not feed nestlings. Younger helpers fed offspring more often than older ones, supporting the skills and group augmentation hypotheses. However, support for the group augmentation hypothesis was mixed since subordinate sex and group size did not explain additional variation in helping propensity and effort. We argue that in addition to indirect and direct benefits, also the costs of helping as well as other types of helping aside from provisioning must be considered to better understand variation in helping behavior. Relatedness is thought to be an important factor explaining helping at the nest by non-breeding group members. We show that placid greenbul helpers are always related to the breeding females, supporting this view. However, many related groups members never helped suggesting that other factors shape helping decision in this species.",NA,NA,,,,10.1093/beheco/arac073,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arac073,1,1,1,,1

Anthropogenic disturbances, due to human presence and/or activities, may be perceived as chronic stressors by wildlife and potentially lead to deleterious effects on traits related to fitness. The main objective of the present study was to highlight the effects of these anthropogenic elements on wild birds on sparsely urbanized farmland, far less studied than in urbanized areas. We investigated during four successive breeding seasons whether the anthropization level, assessed by infrastructure density around nests, and the harvesting conditions around nests may impact physiological, behavioural and life-history traits of Montagu's harrier Circus pygargus chicks. Higher anthropization levels were associated with higher basal corticosterone levels in nestlings during only one breeding season and a lower body condition at fledging for females, probably because they suffered from higher starvation than males. Nestlings reared in more anthropized areas or in harvested crops before their fledging harboured more fault bars on rectrices than those reared in less anthropized areas or in unharvested crops regardless of year and sex, which is suggestive of higher stress during development. Nestling behaviours were also impacted by anthropization level and harvesting conditions: chicks in harvested crops were more aggressive and in areas with higher anthropization levels more prone to escape than others. Because Montagu's harrier is a protected species, the impacts highlighted in the present study are a matter of concern, especially regarding farmland landscape modifications, and we advise limiting perturbations in areas where Montagu's harriers usually nest.",NA,NA,,,,10.1111/acv.12810,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/acv.12810,0,,,,
2022-146,"Macqueen, EI; Ruxton, GD",The adaptive function of construction of multiple non-breeding nests in birds,IBIS,"Several bird species construct multiple nests within a single breeding season that are not used for egg-laying. This behaviour has puzzled researchers for over 100 years, as nests are costly in time and energy to build, and there is no apparent adaptive function. We review the empirical evidence for several suggested non-exclusive functions and examine the plausibility of each. These functions are: (1) decoys to reduce predation or brood parasitism, (2) involvement in sexual selection and signalling of traits such as genetic quality or propensity for parental investment, (3) shelters for adults and/or fledglings, and (4) defence against nest usurpation. We argue that evidence for all these explanations is inconclusive, with correlational studies dominating the literature. We conclude that the idea that these nests evolved as decoys or as shelters for fledglings is unlikely and consider the most likely adaptive function to be signalling. Multiple nests are often involved in aspects of courtship, so are likely have some role in sexual selection in certain species. After pairing, individuals may be able to signal their parental abilities, inducing their partner to invest more in reproduction through differential allocation. We give suggestions for future work which we believe will advance our understanding of ancillary nest-building.",NA,NA,,,,10.1111/ibi.13115,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.13115,0,,,,
2022-147,"Brisson-Curadeau, E; Elliott, K; Bost, CA",Contrasting bottom-up effects of warming ocean on two king penguin populations,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,"Breeding success is often correlated with climate, but the underlying bottom-up mechanisms remain elusive-particularly in marine environments. Consequently, conservation plans of many species often consider climate change as a unilateral threat, ignoring that even nearby populations can show contradicting trends with climate. Better understanding the relationship between climate and environment at different scales can help us interpret local differences in population trends, ultimately providing better tools to evaluate the global response of a species to threats such as global warming. We studied a growing king penguin population nesting at Kerguelen island (Southern Indian Ocean), hosting one of the largest colonies in the world. We used a unique dataset of foraging, breeding success, and climate data spanning over 25 years to examine the links between climate, marine environment, and breeding success at this colony. The results were then compared to the neighboring population of Crozet, which experienced the steepest decline for this species over the past few decades. At Crozet, penguins experienced lower breeding success in warmer years due to productive currents shifting away from the colony, affecting foraging behavior during chick rearing. At Kerguelen, while chick mass and survival experienced extreme variation from year to year, the annual variation was not associated with the position of the currents, which varied very little compared to the situation in Crozet. Rather than being affected by prey distribution shifts, we found evidence that chick provisioning in Kerguelen might be influenced by prey abundance, which seem to rather increase in warmer conditions. Furthermore, warmer air temperature in winter increased chick survival rate, likely due to reduced thermoregulation cost. Investigating the mechanisms between climate and fitness allowed us to predict two different fates for these populations regarding ongoing global warming.",NA,NA,,,,10.1111/gcb.16519,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.16519,1,1,0,no provisioning data,
